      "problemStatement": "Claims prevention today is largely reactive — insurers only act once a loss event occurs (fire, flood, structural failure). There is no systematic predictive monitoring of insured assets. This leads to higher frequency/severity of claims, higher costs, and limited ability to support clients with proactive advice.",
