VALIDATION CHECKPOINT: AI INVENTORY INTEGRATION - PHASES 1A, 1B, 2A

You have completed schema extension (1A), migration script (1B), and conditional form rendering (2A). 
Please perform comprehensive validation to ensure implementation follows LEGO architecture principles.

PHASE 1A VALIDATION: Schema Extension
=================================== 

1. Check shared/schema.ts file:
   - Verify use_cases table includes these NEW governance fields:
     * aiOrModel: text (nullable)
     * riskToCustomers: text (nullable) 
     * riskToRsa: text (nullable)
     * dataUsed: text (nullable)
     * modelOwner: text (nullable)
     * rsaPolicyGovernance: text (nullable)
     * thirdPartyModel: boolean (default false)
     * validationResponsibility: text (nullable)
     * informedBy: text (nullable)

   - Confirm existing 46 columns remain UNCHANGED
   - Verify camelCase naming convention maintained
   - Check Drizzle ORM types are properly defined

EXPECTED RESULT: use_cases table should have 55 total columns (46 existing + 9 new)

PHASE 1B VALIDATION: Database Migration
====================================

2. Check database migration was successful:
   - Run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM use_cases; 
     Expected: 25 records (existing use cases intact)
   
   - Run: SELECT aiOrModel, riskToCustomers FROM use_cases LIMIT 1;
     Expected: NULL values for existing records (backward compatibility)
   
   - Verify API endpoints still work:
     GET /api/use-cases should return all 25 existing records
   
   - Check admin panel still loads without errors

EXPECTED RESULT: All existing functionality preserved, new fields available

PHASE 2A VALIDATION: Conditional Form Rendering  
============================================

3. Check form component updates:
   - Verify use case form shows strategic fields for library_source = 'rsa_internal'
   - Confirm form hides governance fields for existing strategic use cases
   - Test that form submission still works for existing use case editing
   - Check that new governance fields appear when library_source would be 'sharepoint_import'

   Key files to check:
   - Form components show conditional field rendering
   - FormField components from shadcn/ui reused (not duplicated)
   - Existing form validation logic preserved
   - LEGO form standards maintained (text-base font-semibold text-gray-900)

EXPECTED RESULT: Single form handles both strategic and governance data types

ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE CHECK:
=============================

4. Verify LEGO principles maintained:
   ✅ No new major components created
   ✅ Existing component patterns reused
   ✅ camelCase naming throughout
   ✅ Database follows established patterns
   ✅ Form components follow LEGO standards
   ✅ Backward compatibility preserved

5. Test existing workflows:
   - Admin panel loads correctly
   - Use case creation/editing works normally
   - Dashboard displays existing data properly
   - PDF export functions correctly
   - Search and filtering work as before

REPORT VALIDATION RESULTS:
========================

Please provide a summary report covering:
1. Schema changes verified ✅/❌
2. Database migration successful ✅/❌  
3. Form conditional rendering working ✅/❌
4. Existing functionality preserved ✅/❌
5. LEGO architecture principles maintained ✅/❌
6. Any issues discovered and resolution status

If any validation fails, identify the specific issue and recommend fix before proceeding to Phase 2B.

NEXT PHASE READINESS:
===================
Only proceed to Phase 2B (CleanUseCaseCard updates + data migration) if ALL validation checks pass.
