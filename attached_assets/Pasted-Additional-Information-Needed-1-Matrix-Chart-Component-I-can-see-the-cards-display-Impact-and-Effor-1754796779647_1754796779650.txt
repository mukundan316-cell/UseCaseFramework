Additional Information Needed
1. Matrix/Chart Component
I can see the cards display Impact and Effort scores (4.0 each in the example), but I need to see:

The actual matrix/chart visualization code - Is there a visual 2x2 matrix or scatter plot showing the quadrants? If yes, can you show me that component's code?

2. Current Quadrant Assignment Logic
I can see the quadrant badges (Strategic Bet, Experimental, etc.) on the cards. Can you show me:

The function that determines which quadrant a use case belongs to based on Impact/Effort scores
Where this calculation happens (frontend utility, backend API, or database)

3. Scoring Calculation Code
I can see the 10 scoring sliders in the modal:

Business Value: Revenue Impact, Cost Savings, Risk Reduction, Broker/Partner Experience
Feasibility: Data Readiness, Technical Complexity, Change Impact, Model Risk
AI Governance: Explainability & Bias, Regulatory Compliance

Can you show me:

The actual calculation function that converts these 10 scores into Impact and Effort values
Is "Strategic Fit" and "Adoption Readiness" missing from the UI, or renamed?

4. Current Scoring Formula
From your Admin panel screenshot, I see:
Impact = (Revenue×20% + Cost×40% + Risk×20% + Experience×10% + Strategic×10%) ÷ 100
Effort = (Data×20% + Technical×20% + Change×20% + ModelRisk×20% + Adoption×20%) ÷ 100
But the modal only shows 10 levers, not 12. Can you confirm:

Where are "Strategic Fit" and "Adoption Readiness" in the UI?
Are they stored but not displayed?

5. Quadrant Colors and Positions
Currently showing:

Strategic Bet (blue badge)
Experimental (yellow/amber badge)

What are the current quadrant positions in your matrix? Is it:

Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right?
And which quadrant is currently in which position?

6. Database Schema for Use Cases
Can you show me the use_cases table structure, specifically:

What columns store the scoring values?
Is there a column for each of the 12 levers?
How are Impact and Effort scores stored?

7. The Threshold Value
I see threshold is 3.0 in the Admin panel.

Is this value stored in the database or hardcoded?
Can it be changed through the UI?

8. Any Console Errors
When you:

Save a use case with scores
View the Explorer page
Filter by quadrants

Are there any console errors or warnings?

Once you provide these details, I'll create a surgical fix that:

Corrects the quadrant mapping (if needed)
Aligns the scoring formula with the visible levers
Ensures all 12 levers are properly handled
Maintains all your existing LEGO components
Preserves database persistence

The fix will be minimal and precise, only touching what needs to be corrected while preserving all your working functionality.
