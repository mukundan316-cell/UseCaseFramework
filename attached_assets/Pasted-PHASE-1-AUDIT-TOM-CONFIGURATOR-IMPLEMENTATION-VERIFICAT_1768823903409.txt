PHASE 1 AUDIT: TOM CONFIGURATOR IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION

DO NOT make any changes. READ-ONLY audit to verify Phase 1 completion.

=== SCHEMA VERIFICATION ===

1. Check metadata_config table:
   □ Does tomConfig JSONB field exist?
   □ What is the current structure stored?
   □ Are all 4 presets defined?
   □ Are all 4 phases configured with correct mappings?
   □ Are governance bodies configured?
   □ Are derivation rules present?

2. Check use_cases table:
   □ Does tomPhaseOverride field exist?
   □ Does phaseEnteredAt field exist?
   □ Does tomOverrideReason field exist?
   □ How many use cases have tomPhaseOverride set? (should be 0 or few)
   □ How many use cases have phaseEnteredAt populated?

=== API VERIFICATION ===

3. Check server/routes.ts for TOM endpoints:
   □ GET /api/tom/config exists?
   □ PUT /api/tom/config exists?
   □ GET /api/tom/phase-summary exists?
   □ Does GET /api/use-cases return derived TOM phase?

4. Test phase derivation logic:
   □ Where is derivePhase() function implemented?
   □ Does it handle manual override first?
   □ Does it handle "On Hold" → Foundation mapping?
   □ Does it handle NULL deploymentStatus correctly?
   □ Does it handle Steady State as manual-only?

=== UI VERIFICATION ===

5. Admin Panel - TOM Configuration Tab:
   □ Does TOM Configuration tab exist in Admin?
   □ Is there an enable/disable toggle?
   □ Can presets be selected?
   □ Are phases displayed and editable?
   □ Are governance bodies displayed and editable?
   □ Can phase order be changed?

6. Use Case Edit Form:
   □ Is TOM Phase Override dropdown present (when TOM enabled)?
   □ Is Override Reason field present?
   □ Does selecting override require reason?

7. Dashboard Integration:
   □ Is TOM Phase Breakdown visible on Executive Dashboard (when enabled)?
   □ Does it show correct counts per phase?
   □ Is it hidden when TOM is disabled?

8. Use Case Detail View:
   □ Is TOM phase badge/indicator visible?
   □ Does it show derived vs overridden status?

=== DATA VERIFICATION ===

9. Run phase derivation on all 126 use cases:
   □ How many map to Foundation?
   □ How many map to Strategic?
   □ How many map to Transition?
   □ How many map to Steady State (should be 0 unless manually set)?
   □ How many are "Unmapped"? (should be 0)

10. Verify phase history:
    □ Pick 3 use cases with known status changes
    □ Does phaseEnteredAt reflect when they entered current phase?

=== DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION ===

11. Check replit.md:
    □ Is TOM feature documented?
    □ Are tomConfig fields documented?
    □ Are new use_cases fields documented?

12. Check for any new documentation files:
    □ Any TOM-specific README or guide?
