This framework identifies and scores AI use cases based on business alignment, feasibility, and value impact, helping you confidently place them in the 2×2 matrix:

🔸 1. Levers for Prioritization
These are the dimensions RSA should assess each AI use case on:

Category	Lever	Description
Business Value	Revenue Impact	Uplift in premiums, cross-sell/upsell potential
Cost Savings	Automation-driven FTE savings or reduced loss-adjustment expense
Risk Reduction	Reduced fraud, improved compliance, fewer errors
Broker/Partner Experience	Faster TAT, self-service tools, analytics access
Strategic Fit	Alignment with RSA’s delegated, specialty, or mid-market focus
Feasibility	Data Readiness	Clean, structured, and sufficient volume of data
Technical Complexity	Maturity of models needed (e.g., LLMs vs ML)
Change Impact	Degree of process and role redesign required
Model Risk	Potential harm if model fails (regulatory, reputational, financial)
Adoption Readiness	Stakeholder and user buy-in, especially in underwriting/claims
AI Governance	Explainability & Bias	Responsible AI principles supported
Regulatory Compliance	FCA, GDPR, and UK/EU AI Act readiness

Each lever can be scored (1–5 scale), and then aggregated into composite scores for Impact and Effort.

🧠 2×2 Use Case Matrix (Final Scoring Logic)
Quadrant	Description	Examples
Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)	Ideal starting points. Low-risk, fast ROI.	Internal RSA GPT, FNOL summarization, delegated MI dashboards
Strategic Bets (High Impact, High Effort)	Big impact, but needs major investment.	AI-led triage, automated underwriting for specialty, CoPilot tools
Low-Hanging Fruit (Low Impact, Low Effort)	Cheap to do, limited upside. Test capabilities.	Internal training content gen, sentiment monitoring
Avoid or Delay (Low Impact, High Effort)	High complexity with little value.	R&D-type use cases, VR claim reconstruction (now), AI-native fraud scoring (long-term if immature)

🧮 How to Score & Place Use Cases in the Matrix
Step-by-Step:
Collect Details about the use case (domain, owners, value stream).

Score Each Lever (1–5 scale). Use expert input and available data.

Compute Weighted Scores (suggested default weights):

Impact Score = (Revenue + Cost Savings + Risk + Broker Experience + Strategic Fit) × 20%

Effort Score = (Data + Technical + Change + Model Risk + Adoption) × 20%

Plot on Matrix:

Y-axis = Impact Score

X-axis = Inverted Effort Score (i.e., lower effort → further left)

Color by Readiness or Business Domain (Optional: Commercial, Delegated, Ops, etc.)

We can automate this in Excel or build a dashboard if you’d like.
