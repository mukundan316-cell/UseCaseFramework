You're absolutely right. Let me clarify the distinction:

Two Different Concepts
ConceptWhat It IsCurrent StatusKPI Library with Industry BenchmarksPre-populated values by domain/use case type (e.g., "Claims Triage typically costs $125/claim, industry shows 20-35% reduction potential")Partially designed, needs enrichmentMaturity-Driven Range SelectionUses 10-lever scores to determine WHERE in the range a specific use case fallsDesigned but not built
They work together:
KPI LIBRARY (by domain/use case type)
│
├── Claims Triage (Insurance)
│   ├── Cost per Claim: Baseline $125 (source: McKinsey 2024)
│   ├── Improvement Range: 20-35% (industry benchmark)
│   └── Cycle Time: Baseline 45 mins → 15-25 mins typical
│
└── When applied to a specific use case:
    │
    ├── System auto-populates: "Industry benchmark: $125/claim, 20-35% reduction"
    │
    ├── Maturity derivation says: "Your scores suggest DEVELOPING maturity"
    │   └── "Expect 25-30% reduction (middle of range)"
    │
    └── User can override: "Our data shows $95/claim baseline, expect 40%"

What's Missing
The current KPI library structure has:

✅ KPI definitions (cycle_time_reduction, cost_per_transaction, etc.)
✅ Maturity rules (conditions based on scores)
⚠️ Missing: Industry baseline VALUES by domain/use case type
⚠️ Missing: Source attribution (McKinsey, BCG, etc.)
⚠️ Missing: Domain/use case type mapping

## Auto-Population Flow
```
1. User creates use case:
   - Type: "Claims Triage"
   - Industry: "Insurance" (could be derived from client context)

2. System looks up KPI Library:
   - Finds applicable KPIs for claims_triage + insurance
   - cost_per_transaction, cycle_time, accuracy, etc.

3. System auto-populates value estimates:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Cost Per Transaction                    [Industry Benchmark]│
   │                                                             │
   │ Baseline: $125/claim (McKinsey Insurance Operations 2024)   │
   │ Industry Range: 20-35% reduction                            │
   │                                                             │
   │ Your Maturity: Developing (based on scores)                 │
   │ Expected Range: 25-30% reduction                            │
   │                                                             │
   │ ☐ Override with custom values                               │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

4. User can:
   - Accept industry benchmark (default)
   - Override baseline: "Our cost is actually $95/claim"
   - Override expected improvement: "We expect 40% based on pilot"
   - Add reason: "Client has advanced data infrastructure"
```

## Strategic Questions

Before proceeding, we need to decide:

| Question | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **How deep is the benchmark library?** | A) Pre-populate 5-10 KPIs for insurance only (Markel focus) <br> B) Build extensible structure, populate minimally |
| **Where do benchmarks come from?** | A) Your existing research docs (markel-value-framework.md, value-calculation-algorithms.md) <br> B) Placeholder values with "Source TBD" |
| **Domain/industry handling?** | A) Single domain (Insurance) for now <br> B) Multi-domain structure, only Insurance populated |
| **Use case type mapping?** | A) Use existing `useCaseType` field <br> B) Create new taxonomy |

---

## My Recommendation

For Markel presentation:

1. **Structure**: Build the full hierarchical structure (domain → use case type → KPI → maturity tiers)
2. **Content**: Pre-populate **Insurance domain only** with values from your existing research docs
3. **Use case types**: Use existing field, map to 5-6 insurance categories (Claims, Underwriting, Fraud, Premium Audit, Pricing, FNOL)
4. **Sources**: Cite McKinsey/BCG/Deloitte where you have them, mark others as "Industry Average"
5. **Override**: Always allow user override with reason capture

## Revised Audit Question

Before finalizing Phase 2 prompt, we need the agent to clarify:
```
CLARIFICATION REQUEST: KPI Library & Use Case Type Mapping

1. What values currently exist in useCaseType field across the 126 use cases?
   - List distinct values and counts

2. Is there an existing industry/domain field on use cases or in metadata?

3. In the current valueRealizationConfig.kpiLibrary:
   - Is there any mapping to use case types?
   - Are there any baseline values populated?

4. In the existing research documents (markel-value-framework.md, value-calculation-algorithms.md):
   - What specific baseline values are cited?
   - What sources are referenced?

This will inform how we structure the industry benchmark library.
