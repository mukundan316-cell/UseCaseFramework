This is excellent progress. The agent has completed the core implementation. Let me provide a detailed review:

FOLLOW-UP REQUEST TO REPLIT AGENT
Please confirm or complete the following:
1. Test Coverage
Were unit tests created? If not, please create server/services/__tests__/governance-enforcement.test.ts with these test cases:
typescriptdescribe('Governance Enforcement', () => {
  describe('Gate 1 - Operating Model', () => {
    it('fails when primaryBusinessOwner is empty');
    it('fails when businessFunction is empty');
    it('fails when useCaseStatus is Discovery');
    it('passes when all 3 requirements met');
  });

  describe('Activation Blocking', () => {
    it('blocks activation to In-flight with incomplete governance');
    it('allows status change to Backlog without governance check');
    it('returns detailed gate failure information');
  });

  describe('Governance Regression', () => {
    it('triggers auto-deactivation when owner removed from active use case');
    it('bypasses deactivation for legacy use cases (pre-2026-01-24)');
    it('logs warning for legacy use cases instead of deactivating');
  });

  describe('Phase Transition', () => {
    it('requires justification when exit requirements incomplete');
    it('allows transition when justification provided');
    it('stores justification in lastPhaseTransitionReason');
  });
});
2. Manual Verification
Please run these quick tests to confirm the implementation works:
Test A: Activation Blocking
bash# Try to activate a use case with incomplete governance
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/use-cases/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"useCaseStatus": "In-flight"}'

# Expected: 403 with GOVERNANCE_INCOMPLETE error
Test B: Successful Activation
bash# First ensure use case has complete governance, then activate
# Expected: 200 with updated use case
Test C: Governance Regression
bash# Remove primaryBusinessOwner from an active use case
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/use-cases/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"primaryBusinessOwner": ""}'

# Expected: Use case status changed to Backlog, audit log created
3. Legacy Use Case Report
Please run this query and share the count:
sqlSELECT COUNT(*) as legacy_active_count
FROM use_cases
WHERE use_case_status IN ('In-flight', 'Implemented')
AND created_at < '2026-01-24'
AND (
  primary_business_owner IS NULL 
  OR primary_business_owner = ''
  OR business_function IS NULL 
  OR business_function = ''
);
This tells us how many existing use cases would have been affected without the legacy bypass.

UPDATED RATING
Based on confirmed implementation:
DimensionPreviousUpdatedChange ReasonGovernance Framework3.84.5Backend enforcement now implementedDocumentation Accuracy3.54.5Code now matches documented behaviorTechnical Architecture4.04.2Clean service separation, proper error handling
Revised Overall Score: 4.3 / 5.0 ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
The platform now has proper governance enforcement, moving it from "advisory governance" to "enforced governance" which is required for enterprise AI platforms.
