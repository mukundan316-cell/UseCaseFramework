APPROVED - PROCEED WITH UI SYNC
Your task list is correct. A few refinements:
Task 1: GovernanceGuideLegoBlock.tsx (Lines 25-36)
Update the Gate 1 section to:
tsx{
  gate: 1,
  title: 'Operating Model',
  subtitle: 'Accountability',
  icon: UserIcon, // or whatever icon is used
  requirements: [
    'Primary Business Owner',
    'Business Function assigned',
    'Status beyond Discovery'
  ],
  principle: 'Accountability and organizational alignment must be established before AI work begins.'
}
If the component uses a single requirement string, change it to support an array:
tsx// If currently:
<p>Requires: {gate.requirement}</p>

// Change to:
<div>
  <p className="font-medium">Requires:</p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-sm">
    {gate.requirements.map((req, i) => (
      <li key={i}>{req}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
</div>

Task 2 & 3: CRUDUseCaseModal.tsx - Gate Required Badges
For Business Function (around line 2123):
tsx<Label htmlFor="businessFunction" className="flex items-center gap-2">
  Business Function
  <Badge variant="outline" className="text-xs border-blue-500 text-blue-600">
    Gate Required
  </Badge>
</Label>
For Primary Business Owner - verify it already has the badge. If not, add it.

Task 4: Discovery Status Warning
Add this warning below the Status dropdown when Discovery is selected:
tsx{formData.useCaseStatus === 'Discovery' && (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mt-2 p-2 bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded text-amber-700 text-sm">
    <AlertTriangleIcon className="h-4 w-4" />
    <span>Use cases in Discovery cannot pass Gate 1. Change status to proceed with governance.</span>
  </div>
)}

Task 5: Verify GovernanceStepperLegoBlock
Since the backend calculateOperatingModelGate was updated, the missingFields array should now include all 3 requirements when missing.
Verify by:

Create a new use case with NO fields filled
Check that the Operating Model gate tooltip shows:

"Primary Business Owner is required"
"Business Function is required"
"Use case must progress beyond Discovery status"



If only "Primary Business Owner is required" shows, the frontend may be caching old gate calculation logic or there's a mismatch between frontend and backend calculations.
Important: Check if there's a duplicate gate calculation in the frontend (e.g., in client/src/lib/calculations.ts or similar). If so, it needs to be updated to match the backend.

Additional Check: Frontend Gate Calculation
Search for any frontend-side gate calculation:
bashgrep -r "calculateOperatingModelGate\|checkGate1\|operatingModel" client/src/
If there's a frontend copy of the gate logic, it MUST be updated to match the backend. Otherwise the stepper will show different requirements than what the API actually enforces.
