You are a Replit Agent tasked with building a professional, extensible microsite for RSA Insurance to manage and prioritize AI use cases across its commercial insurance operations.

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Develop a modular and extensible microsite that enables:
- Adding and scoring AI use cases
- Filtering by business and technical metadata
- Visualizing use cases in a 2x2 impact-effort matrix
- Managing filter taxonomies dynamically (LEGO-style)
- Scaling to new features (e.g., tabs, dashboards) without disrupting existing components

🧩 KEY ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENT:
Design the system using **modular, mutually exclusive feature components** that:
- Share a **common data model** and **data store**
- Can be **added, modified, or removed independently**
- Do not require rewrites of existing components when new functionality is added
- Respect **separation of concerns** via scoped React components and route-level isolation

🧱 COMPONENTS TO BUILD NOW:

1. 📦 **Metadata Manager**
   - UI to manage dropdown values for:
     - Value Chain Component
     - Process (within Value Chain)
     - Business Segment
     - Line of Business (LOB)
     - Geography
     - Use Case Type (GenAI, ML, etc.)
   - Allow creation, edit, and deletion of metadata values
   - Persist config in localStorage or as a shared JSON config structure

2. 🧠 **Use Case Form & Scoring Engine**
   - Inputs:
     - Title, Description
     - Metadata (from above filters)
     - Scoring sliders (1–5) for:
       - Revenue Impact, Cost Savings, Risk Reduction, Strategic Fit
       - Data Readiness, Tech Complexity, Change Impact, Adoption Readiness
   - Compute:
     - Impact Score = Avg(Business levers)
     - Effort Score = Avg(Feasibility levers)
     - Quadrant: based on position in 2×2 matrix
   - Save use case object to centralized store (localStorage or mock backend)

3. 📊 **2×2 Matrix View**
   - Plot use cases using Recharts or Plotly
   - X = Effort (inverted), Y = Impact
   - Tooltip with use case name, quadrant, and metadata
   - Color by Business Segment or LOB

4. 🧾 **Use Case Explorer**
   - Card/grid display of use cases
   - Filterable by:
     - Value Chain, Process, Segment, LOB, Geography, Quadrant
   - Search by keyword
   - Responsive layout

5. ⚙️ **Config Panel (Admin View)**
   - View/edit all metadata schemas
   - Import/export as JSON
   - Button to reset use cases or metadata

✅ CRITICAL DESIGN INSTRUCTIONS:
- Each component (Matrix, Explorer, Form, Admin) must be **self-contained and route-scoped**
- All modules should use a **shared data service** (e.g., `useCaseStore.js` or equivalent)
- Allow **future tabs/features** (e.g., dashboards, GenAI readiness checker, export tools) to plug in using the same data schema
- No coupling between UI features — allow new features without modifying or duplicating logic from existing ones

🎨 UI DESIGN:
- React + Tailwind CSS
- RSA branding:
  - Primary Blue: #005DAA
  - Background: #F7F8F9
  - Cards: White with soft shadows and 2xl rounded corners
- Sticky header with navigation tabs
- Responsive: Works well on tablet and desktop

📁 DATA STORAGE:
- Use localStorage for MVP
- Central JSON structure: `useCases[]`, `metadataConfig{}`
- (Optional: mock API-ready, e.g., use axios or fetch wrappers)

🧪 BONUS:
- Add 3 sample use cases
- Include tooltip icons on each scoring slider
- Component folder structure:
  - `/components/UseCaseForm`
  - `/components/MatrixPlot`
  - `/components/Explorer`
  - `/components/Admin`
  - `/services/useCaseStore.js`

💡 USER INTENT:
Enable RSA to prioritize AI use cases across value chain components, business segments, and geographies — and scale the tool incrementally as an internal digital asset without breaking the core.
