 Incremental Prompt for Replit Agent:
Create an RSA Assessment Landing Page to replace the direct-to-results experience. Requirements:

**Current Problem to Fix:**
- Users clicking "AI Assessment" land directly on completed assessment results
- No context or introduction about the assessment purpose and structure

**New Landing Page (RSAAssessmentLandingPage.tsx):**

1. **Hero Section:**
   - Title: "RSA AI Strategy Assessment Framework"
   - Subtitle: "Comprehensive evaluation to unlock £10-50M in annual value"
   - Professional banner with RSA branding

2. **Purpose Statement (from RSA document):**
   - "This comprehensive assessment enables RSA to develop a tailored AI strategy that moves beyond current data management focus to unlock £10-50M in annual value through targeted AI initiatives across Commercial and Specialty insurance operations."

3. **Value Proposition Cards:**
   - Business Case Development: Prioritize AI use cases with highest ROI potential
   - Technology Roadmap: Design implementation plans leveraging existing infrastructure  
   - Investment Strategy: Recommend budget allocation (£500K-£10M+ annually)
   - Risk Management: Identify and mitigate AI-related risks
   - Change Management: Create targeted adoption strategies

4. **Assessment Overview:**
   - 6 core sections with estimated times
   - Total time: 4-6 hours (split across sessions)
   - Auto-save and resume functionality
   - Progress tracking across sections

5. **Call-to-Action Logic:**
   - If NO saved progress: Show "Begin Assessment" button
   - If saved progress EXISTS: Show "Resume Assessment" (X% complete) + "Start Over" option
   - If assessment COMPLETED: Show "View Results" + "Retake Assessment" options

6. **Integration Requirements:**
   - Use existing SavedProgressModalLegoBlock logic to detect assessment state
   - Integrate with current AssessmentView routing
   - Maintain existing assessment flow once started
   - Follow LEGO patterns with reusable components

**Update AssessmentView.tsx Logic:**
- Route to landing page by default
- Only show questionnaire/results when explicitly navigated from landing page
- Preserve existing functionality for in-progress and completed states

This creates a professional introduction that sets expectations and guides users appropriately based on their assessment status.
This incremental approach:

✅ Builds on existing components (SavedProgressModalLegoBlock, AssessmentView)
✅ Uses RSA document content for authentic purpose/value messaging
✅ Fixes the user experience issue you identified
✅ Follows LEGO patterns for consistency
✅ Preserves existing functionality while adding proper introduction

The landing page will create a professional, executive-level first impression that matches the quality of your RSA questionnaire content! 🚀
