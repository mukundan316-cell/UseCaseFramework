AUDIT REQUEST: Insurance KPI Benchmarks & Value Conversion

Search the project knowledge base and codebase for existing benchmark data.

=== PART 1: EXISTING BENCHMARK DATA ===

1. In markel-value-framework.md and value-calculation-algorithms.md:
   - List ALL specific numeric benchmarks mentioned
   - Format: | KPI | Baseline Value | Improvement Range | Source |

2. In RSAAITOM.pdf:
   - Any benchmark values or KPIs mentioned?
   - Any value calculations shown?

3. In the database (126 use cases):
   - Do any use cases have estimatedValue populated?
   - Do any have successMetrics with numeric targets?
   - Sample the populated values

=== PART 2: INSURANCE PROCESS → KPI MAPPING ===

4. For each of the 14 processes, what KPIs would logically apply?

   | Process | Applicable KPIs |
   |---------|-----------------|
   | Claims Management | cost_per_claim, cycle_time, accuracy, loss_ratio |
   | Underwriting & Triage | decision_time, cost_per_submission, accuracy |
   | ... | ... |

5. Review the 75+ activities - can they be grouped into KPI categories?

=== PART 3: VALUE CONVERSION LOGIC ===

6. Is there any existing value calculation logic in the codebase?
   - T-shirt sizing has cost calculations - how does it work?
   - Any ROI or value formulas already implemented?

7. What client-specific parameters would be needed for value conversion?
   - Volume (claims/year, policies/year, etc.)
   - Cost rates (£/hour, £/FTE, etc.)
   - GWP (for COR calculations)

=== PART 4: AGGREGATION REQUIREMENTS ===

8. For Markel specifically, what enterprise metrics matter?
   - Combined Operating Ratio (COR)?
   - Total cost savings?
   - FTE efficiency?
   - Revenue uplift?

9. In the existing dashboard/analytics:
   - What aggregations already exist?
   - Portfolio Investment total?
   - Any value rollups?
