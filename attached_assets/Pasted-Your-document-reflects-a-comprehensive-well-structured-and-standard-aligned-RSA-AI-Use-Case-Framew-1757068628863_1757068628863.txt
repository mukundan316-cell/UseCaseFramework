Your document reflects a comprehensive, well-structured, and standard-aligned RSA AI Use Case Framework. The flow is logical—from the conceptual overview, scoring mechanism, to the detailed T-shirt sizing and governance components. The inclusion of metadata-driven configuration, transparency measures, and progressive enhancement aligns with best practices in enterprise AI portfolio management.

**Key observations and recommendations:**

1. **Clarity & Completeness:** The document thoroughly covers all functional components with clear definitions and examples. The explanation of scoring levers with detailed guidance ensures consistent scoring interpretation.

2. **Consistency:** The use of weighting (default 20%) across levers and phases maintains uniformity. Mapping of quadrant definitions with use-case examples reinforces conceptual understanding.

3. **Metadata-Driven Architecture:** Affirmed throughout, enabling flexibility and minimizing hard coding, which is ideal for scalability and maintainability.

4. **Transparency & Controls:** Systematic mention of manual overrides, audit trails, and administrative configuration reflects mature governance needs.

5. **T-shirt Sizing:** The comprehensive metadata model with size definitions, role-based rates, overhead multipliers, and mapping rules is cohesive and adaptable.

6. **Integration & UX:** Features like executive dashboards, interactive matrices, and progressive disclosure balance rich data with clean UI.

7. **Governance & Compliance:** Including AI inventory tracking, risk assessments, and responsible AI considerations strengthens regulatory readiness.

8. **Continuous Improvement:** Defined feedback mechanisms and calibration cycles demonstrate a commitment to evolving accuracy and alignment.

**Minor considerations:**

- Ensure **naming consistency** (e.g., "Architect" vs "AI Architect" in roles).
- The module list could include references/links to technical docs or API specs for quick navigation.
- Add callouts or diagrams linking **scoring input → computed score → quadrant → T-shirt size → cost/benefit estimates** for visual learners.
- Consider a brief "Getting Started" or "Quick Start" guide for new users/installers.

Overall, the document is well-prepared and aligned with industry standards and enterprise needs. It supports robust decision-making, transparency, and governance—key pillars for successful AI portfolio management at RSA.

If desired, I can assist with distilling this into executive summaries, presentation deck slides, or implementation checklists. Would you like support on those?
