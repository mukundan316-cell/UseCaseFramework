Fix Required - Prompt for Replit Agent:
Fix the RSA question types and replace with proper advanced LEGO blocks. Requirements:

1. **Update Question 2** - Change from "multiselect" to "business_lines_matrix"
   - Question: "How is your premium distributed across business lines?"
   - Should show matrix table with premium percentages and growth trends

2. **Update Question 3** - Change from "scale" to "smart_rating" 
   - Question: "How would you rate your current AI strategy maturity?"
   - Should use SmartRatingLegoBlock with maturity variant

3. **Update Question 5** - Change from "scale" to "smart_rating"
   - Question: "What is your risk appetite for AI experimentation?"
   - Should use SmartRatingLegoBlock with capability variant

4. **Verify Missing Advanced Questions:**
   - Currency input questions (GWP, investment budget)
   - Percentage allocation questions (distribution channels, investment allocation)
   - Ranking questions (underwriting priorities, claims priorities)
   - Department skills matrix question

5. **Test QuestionRegistryLegoBlock mapping:**
   - Ensure all new question types map to correct LEGO blocks
   - Verify currency → CurrencyInputLegoBlock
   - Verify business_lines_matrix → BusinessLinesMatrixLegoBlock
   - Verify percentage_allocation → PercentageAllocationLegoBlock
   - Verify ranking → RankingLegoBlock
   - Verify department_skills_matrix → DepartmentSkillsMatrixLegoBlock
   - Verify smart_rating → SmartRatingLegoBlock

Update the questions in the database and refresh the assessment to show the proper advanced components.
🎯 Expected Result:
After the fix, you should see:

✅ Currency inputs with multi-currency selectors
✅ Business lines matrix with percentage and growth trend inputs
✅ Smart rating dropdowns instead of sliders
✅ Ranking components with drag-and-drop functionality
✅ Department skills matrix with tabular data entry
✅ Percentage allocation with 100% validation

The current assessment shows the basic question types, but we need the advanced LEGO blocks to demonstrate the full RSA questionnaire capabilities! 🚀
