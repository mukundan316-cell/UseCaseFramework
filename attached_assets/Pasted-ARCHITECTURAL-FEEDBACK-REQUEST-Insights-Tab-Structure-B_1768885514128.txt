ARCHITECTURAL FEEDBACK REQUEST: Insights Tab Structure

Before implementing, I need your assessment of this proposed approach against replit.md guidelines and existing architecture. DO NOT build anything - only provide feedback.

=== PROPOSED STRUCTURE ===

Add new top-level "Insights" tab with sub-navigation:

Current:  Dashboard | Explorer | AI Assessment | Admin
Proposed: Dashboard | Explorer | Insights | AI Assessment | Admin

Insights sub-tabs:
├── Value Realization (Priority - Phase 2 build)
│   └── Portfolio-level value tracking, ROI, breakeven analytics
├── Operating Model
│   └── Read-only TOM analytics view (config stays in Admin)
├── Capability Transition (Phase 3 build)
│   └── Staffing curves, independence tracking, KT milestones
└── Responsible AI
    └── Consolidated governance/risk view from existing fields

=== KEY DESIGN DECISIONS ===

1. Insights = Analytics/Read Views; Admin = Configuration
2. Default sub-tab when clicking Insights: Value Realization
3. Dashboard summary cards link into relevant Insights sub-tabs
4. Use Case Detail modal keeps per-use-case entry tabs (Value, etc.)
5. Insights shows portfolio-level aggregation across all use cases
6. Placeholder "Coming Soon" for unbuilt sub-tabs initially

=== QUESTIONS FOR YOUR ASSESSMENT ===

1. TAB STRUCTURE FEASIBILITY
   - Does the current routing (Wouter) support nested sub-tabs easily?
   - What's the existing pattern for sub-navigation? (Reference existing components)
   - Any concerns with adding a 5th top-level tab?

2. REPLIT.MD ALIGNMENT
   - Does this follow LEGO component patterns?
   - Does this align with "quick wins without complexity" principle?
   - Any architectural decisions in replit.md that conflict with this approach?

3. EXISTING PATTERNS TO REUSE
   - Which existing components handle sub-navigation? (Tabs within pages)
   - Are there existing "analytics view" patterns to follow?
   - How does Admin panel handle its internal tabs - can we mirror that pattern?

4. DATA FLOW
   - Portfolio aggregation queries - any performance concerns with 126+ use cases?
   - Should aggregations be computed server-side (API) or client-side?
   - Caching considerations?

5. NAVIGATION INTEGRATION
   - How would Dashboard cards link to specific Insights sub-tabs?
   - URL structure recommendation: /insights/value-realization or /insights?tab=value?
   - Back navigation / breadcrumb considerations?

6. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
   - Is there a simpler pattern in the existing codebase that achieves the same goal?
   - Any concerns that suggest a different approach entirely?

7. BUILD SEQUENCE RECOMMENDATION
   - Should we build the Insights shell first (with placeholders), then populate?
   - Or build Value Realization fully, then wrap in Insights structure?
   - What's the lowest-risk sequence?

## ARCHITECTURAL ASSESSMENT

### 1. Tab Structure Feasibility
[Your assessment]

### 2. Replit.md Alignment
[Conflicts or confirmations]

### 3. Recommended Patterns to Reuse
[Specific components/files to reference]

### 4. Data Flow Recommendations
[Server vs client, caching, performance]

### 5. Navigation Approach
[URL structure, linking strategy]

### 6. Concerns or Blockers
[Any issues that need resolution before building]

### 7. Recommended Build Sequence
[Your suggested order of implementation]

### 8. Estimated Complexity
[Low/Medium/High and why]

Provide honest assessment. If this approach is over-engineered or conflicts with existing patterns, say so and suggest alternatives.
