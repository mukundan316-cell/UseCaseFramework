These are critical strategic questions. Let me reflect on each:

1. Can Value Realization Be Reflected at Use Case Level Automatically?
Current State: The plan has derivation logic, but it's triggered on-demand (when user views or edits).
The Real Question: Should every use case automatically have derived value estimates based on its scores, even without user intervention?
ApproachBehaviorTrade-offOn-demand derivationValues calculated when viewed/editedLightweight, but no portfolio-wide visibility until touchedAuto-populationAll 126 use cases get derived values on system startup/migrationImmediate portfolio insights, but may show estimates user hasn't validatedHybridDerive on-demand, but show "estimated" flag in aggregatesBest of both - visibility with transparency
My View: Hybrid is correct. Use cases should show derived estimates automatically (using existing scores), but clearly marked as "System Estimate" until user confirms or overrides.

2. Calculated Values Visible in Existing CRUD Modal
The Concern: We're adding new tabs and views, but are we updating the existing CRUD modal to show derived/calculated values inline?
Currently in CRUD modal:

10-lever scores ✅ (user enters)
T-shirt sizing ✅ (auto-calculated from scores)
TOM Phase ⚠️ (is it visible in modal header?)
Value Estimates ❓ (not yet integrated)
ROI ❓ (not yet integrated)

The Principle: A user editing a use case should see ALL derived values in context, not have to jump to different tabs/pages.
Gap Identified: We may be building "Value Realization" as a separate tab, but not showing the derived estimates in the main Overview/Summary section of the CRUD modal.

3. Is Admin Module Comprehensive?

Gap: We're building features without ensuring Admin can manage all configuration. Each feature should have its Admin counterpart.
