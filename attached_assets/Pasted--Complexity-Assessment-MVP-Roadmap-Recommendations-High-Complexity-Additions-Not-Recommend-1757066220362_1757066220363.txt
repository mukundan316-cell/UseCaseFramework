# Complexity Assessment & MVP Roadmap Recommendations

## High-Complexity Additions (Not Recommended for MVP)
1. **Gantt Chart Visualization**  
   -  Requires integrating a specialized library (e.g. @dhtmlx/gantt) or building custom SVG code  
   -  Complex drag-and-drop event handling, state management, and responsive design  
   -  New data model to capture precise start dates/quarters and dependency logic  
   -  Significant API and front-end overhead

2. **Interactive Timeline UI**  
   -  Date range calculations for positioning  
   -  Complex responsive rendering across devices  
   -  New endpoints for saving timeline adjustments  
   -  Substantial increase in maintenance and test coverage

Adding a full roadmap/Gantt feature at this stage would violate “quick wins without complexity” and draw resources away from core prioritization value.

## Lightweight Alternatives for MVP

These deliver strategic planning visibility with minimal overhead:

1. **Timeline Summary View**  
   -  A simple table sorted by estimated start quarter and duration badge (e.g., “Q1 2026 | 8–16wks”)  
   -  Leverages existing data; no new charting libraries

2. **Export Enhancement**  
   -  Include `startQuarter`, `weeksMin–weeksMax`, and `teamSizeMin–teamSizeMax` in PDF/Excel exports  
   -  Enables downstream roadmap tools (PowerPoint, MS Project) without building interactive UI

3. **Quarter Grouping**  
   -  Add a filter or grouping control in the existing matrix/card view to group use cases by quarter (e.g., Q1, Q2)  
   -  Uses current grid layout; minimal UI change

## MVP Recommendation

-  **Do not** add interactive Gantt charts now  
-  **Focus** on refining T-shirt sizing, cost, and benefit accuracy  
-  **Implement** one or more lightweight alternatives above to provide timeline visibility  
-  **Plan** full roadmap feature for v2, once the prioritization system is validated and adopted by stakeholders

This approach maintains simplicity, delivers planning value, and preserves development capacity for immediate high-impact improvements.
