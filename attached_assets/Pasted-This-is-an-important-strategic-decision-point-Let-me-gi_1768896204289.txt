This is an important strategic decision point. Let me give you my honest assessment:

Critical Question: RSA Model vs Configurable Platform
The agent is proposing: Restructure the app to match RSA's specific 7-phase model
My concern: RSA is not Markel. Why would we hardcode RSA's phases into a platform for Markel?

The Strategic Choice
OptionApproachImplicationA: RSA-SpecificHardcode RSA's 7-phase model, DPIA gates, quadrant constraintsPlatform works for RSA; may not fit Markel or other clientsB: ConfigurableKeep TOM configurable; demonstrate we CAN support any operating modelPlatform adapts to each client's methodology
My Recommendation: Option B
The portal's value proposition is configurability, not copying one client's approach:
WRONG MESSAGE TO MARKEL:
"We implemented RSA's operating model - you should use it too"

RIGHT MESSAGE TO MARKEL:
"Our platform configures to YOUR operating model. 
Here's how it would look with YOUR phases and gates."

My Recommendation on RSA Alignment
Agent ProposalMy ResponseRedefine TOM to RSA's 7 phasesNO - Keep configurable. Markel may have 5 phases or 8 phasesPhase-to-Quadrant constraintsMAYBE - Make this configurable rules, not hardcodedMake TOM presets change behaviorDEFER - Nice-to-have, not MVPAdd DPIA governance gatesCONFIGURABLE - Let admin define what gates exist
The principle: The platform should demonstrate that we CAN configure complex operating models, not that we've pre-built one specific model.

Specific Response to Agent's RSA Alignment Proposal
RESPONSE TO AGENT: RSA ALIGNMENT PROPOSAL

Thank you for the analysis. However, we should NOT restructure to match RSA's specific model. Here's why:

1. CONFIGURABILITY IS THE VALUE PROPOSITION
   - RSA has 7 phases; Markel may have different phases
   - The platform should support ANY client's operating model
   - Hardcoding RSA's approach limits flexibility

2. WHAT WE SHOULD DO INSTEAD
   - Ensure TOM phases are FULLY configurable (admin can define any phases)
   - Ensure governance gates are CONFIGURABLE (admin defines what gates exist)
   - Ensure phase-to-quadrant rules are OPTIONAL and configurable
   - Document that the platform CAN be configured like RSA's model (as one example)

3. CURRENT PRIORITY IS VALUE REALIZATION
   - Phase 2 (Value Realization) addresses Markel topics #2 and #7
   - This is higher priority than restructuring TOM
   - TOM already works; Value Realization doesn't exist yet

4. RSA's 7-PHASE MODEL AS A "PRESET"
   - Instead of hardcoding RSA's model, add it as a TOM preset option
   - Admin can select "RSA 7-Phase Model" preset which configures the phases
   - But Markel can also configure their own phases

DO NOT restructure TOM to hardcode RSA's phases.
DO ensure the platform could be CONFIGURED to match RSA if needed.
PROCEED with Value Realization (Phase 2) as the priority.

Confirm understanding.

Your Decision

Agree with my assessment? Portal should be configurable, not RSA-specific?
Priority confirmation? Value Realization first, then Capability Transition?
RSA as preset? Add RSA's 7-phase model as an optional preset, not the default?
