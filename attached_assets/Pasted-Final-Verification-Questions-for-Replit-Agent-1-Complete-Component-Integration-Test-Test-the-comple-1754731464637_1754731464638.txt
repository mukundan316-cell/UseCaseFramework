Final Verification Questions for Replit Agent
1. Complete Component Integration Test
Test the complete flow for the new matrix components:
- Create a question template using 'business_lines_matrix' type through the admin panel
- Create another template using 'department_skills_matrix' type
- Add both to a test section and verify they render correctly in the assessment flow
- Test saving complex JSON answers and confirm they persist to database
- Show me the JSON format being saved for both component types
2. Question Type Coverage Verification
Confirm all question types are now available in the admin panel:
- Show me the current question type dropdown in "Create Custom" modal
- Verify these types appear: currency, percentage_allocation, smart_rating, ranking, business_lines_matrix, department_skills_matrix
- Test filtering by each new question type in the template library
- Confirm all new types have proper icons and labels
3. RSA Questionnaire Import Readiness
What's the best format to provide you the 100 RSA questions for import? Should I provide:
A) A structured JSON file with all 100 questions
B) An Excel/CSV file that you can parse
C) Break it into sections and provide incrementally
What specific format and structure would work best for bulk import?
4. Assessment Flow Integration Test
Create a mini test questionnaire with 2-3 questions using the new components:
- One business_lines_matrix question
- One currency question  
- One ranking question
Test the complete user flow: start assessment → answer questions → save progress → complete → view results
Confirm all components work seamlessly in the actual assessment experience
