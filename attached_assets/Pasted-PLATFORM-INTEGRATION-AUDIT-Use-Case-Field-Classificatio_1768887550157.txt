System-Derived (on-the-fly)	derivedPhase (TOM phase from status + deploymentStatus + tomConfig)	NOT stored - calculated per API call
CRUD Modal Visibility Assessment
Derived/Calculated Value	Visible in CRUD Modal?	Editable?	Notes
TOM Phase Badge	✅ Yes	Read-only display	Shows when TOM enabled, displays current derived phase
T-shirt Sizing Summary	❌ NO	N/A	Missing - T-shirt size fields exist on schema but not shown in modal
Impact/Effort Scores	✅ Yes (Scoring tab)	User selects lever values, scores auto-calculated	10-lever input with real-time calculation
Quadrant Assignment	❌ NO	N/A	Quadrant is calculated but not displayed in modal
Value Estimates	❌ NO	N/A	Value Realization tab exists but not integrated into CRUD modal

Admin: Value configuration	⚠️ Needs verification	May need dedicated tab
Documentation	⚠️ Minimal	Not detailed in replit.md
Admin Coverage
Configuration	Admin UI Exists?	Location
Metadata (processes, LOBs, etc.)	✅ Yes	Admin > Data Management
Scoring dropdown options	✅ Yes	Admin > Data Management > Scoring Dropdown Options
Scoring model weights	✅ Yes	Admin > System > ScoringModelManagementBlock
T-shirt sizing rates	✅ Yes	Admin > System > TShirtSizingConfigLegoBlock
TOM phases/presets	✅ Yes	Admin > TOM
Value Realization KPIs	❌ MISSING	No dedicated admin tab for KPI library
Aggregation Consistency
Aggregation	Calculated Where	Consistent?
Use cases per quadrant	Frontend (matrix plot)	✅ Uses quadrant from API response
Use cases per TOM phase	Server (/api/tom/phase-summary)	✅ Uses consistent derivation
Portfolio investment	Server (aggregatePortfolioValue)	✅ Central calculation
Resource planning totals	❓ Unknown	T-shirt cost rollup not clearly implemented
Critical Gaps
T-shirt Sizing not visible in CRUD Modal - Fields exist in schema, calculation works, but no UI to view/edit in the use case form
Value Realization not in CRUD Modal - Full tracking system exists but not integrated into individual use case editing
Quadrant not displayed in CRUD Modal - Score is calculated but resulting quadrant isn't shown
No Admin UI for Value Realization KPI Library - Config exists but no way to customize KPIs
T-shirt sizing may not be auto-calculated - API exists but unclear if sizing is recalculated on use case save
Recommendations Before Phase 2
Add T-shirt Sizing display to CRUD Modal - Show calculated size, cost range, and timeline in a read-only section (or editable override)
Add Quadrant display to CRUD Modal - Show which quadrant the use case falls into based on scores
Consider Value Realization tab in CRUD Modal - Allow entering KPIs, investment, and tracking data per use case
Add Value Config Admin tab - Enable admins to customize the KPI library
Ensure T-shirt sizing auto-calculates on save - Verify or add recalculation logic when scores change
Update replit.md - Document Value Realization feature fully
This audit shows the platform has solid schema and backend infrastructure for all major features, but T-shirt sizing and Value Realization have visibility gaps in the CRUD modal - users can't see or interact with these features when creating/editing individual use cases.
