Excellent, thank you for sharing the screenshots. Your current "Edit Use Case" form is already very strong and comprehensive. You've done a great job creating a robust framework.

Here’s a breakdown of what works well and some suggestions for enhancement, based on best practices for these kinds of strategic tools.

What's Working Really Well:
Structured Scoring: The three-pillar assessment (Business Value, Feasibility, AI Governance) is excellent. It ensures a holistic view beyond just impact vs. effort and brings in crucial governance aspects right from the start.

Granular Levers: The specific sliders for Revenue Impact, Data Readiness, Model Risk, etc., are perfect. They guide the user to think about the use case from multiple important angles.

Calculated Scores & Quadrant: Automatically calculating the Impact Score, Effort Score, and resulting Quadrant is key for standardization and objective comparison.

Manual Override: The "Manual Score Override" feature is a standout. It shows maturity by acknowledging that quantitative models need a layer of strategic judgment. This is a feature many enterprise tools miss.

Business Context: The multi-select options for LOB, Segment, and Geography are great for filtering and portfolio analysis.

Suggestions for Enhancement
Your current form is great for scoring a use case. The following suggestions aim to make it a complete single source of truth for the use case's entire lifecycle, from idea to value realization.

I would recommend restructuring the modal into tabs to make it less overwhelming and easier to navigate.

Proposed Tab Structure for the "Edit/View Use Case" Modal
Tab 1: Overview (Your current "Basic Information" & "Business Context")
This is largely what you have now. I'd suggest one addition:

Add "Problem Statement" Field: Right below the Description, add a field for "Problem Statement / Business Need."

Why: A Description says what the use case is. A Problem Statement says why it needs to exist (e.g., "Our current claims processing time is 25% higher than the industry average, leading to poor customer satisfaction and increased operational costs."). This is crucial for building the business case.

Tab 2: Strategic Assessment (Your current scoring sliders)
This section is nearly perfect. No major changes are needed here. It effectively captures the inputs for your prioritization matrix.

Tab 3: Implementation & Governance (A new, consolidated tab)
This tab would house the practical details needed for planning and execution.

Add a "Project Details" Section:

Primary Business Owner: A dropdown to assign a single point of contact for accountability.

Use Case Status: A dropdown with options like Discovery, Backlog, In-flight, Implemented, On Hold. This is vital for tracking.

Key Dependencies: A text field to note dependencies on other projects, data sources, or teams (e.g., "Dependent on Guidewire API completion," "Requires data from Project Atlas").

Add a "Value Realization" Section:

Success Metrics / KPIs: This is a critical addition. It's a field to define how success will be measured. (e.g., "Reduce manual review time by 30%", "Increase quote-to-bind ratio by 5%", "Achieve a 10-point uplift in Broker NPS").

Estimated Value (£): A field to quantify the expected financial impact, tying back to the "value if solved" concept in your discovery questionnaire.

Move "AI Governance Levers" Here:

Your AI Governance sliders (Explainability, Regulatory Compliance, Model Risk) fit perfectly in this section, as they are key considerations for implementation.
