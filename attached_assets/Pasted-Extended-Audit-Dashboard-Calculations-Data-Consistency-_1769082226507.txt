Extended Audit: Dashboard Calculations & Data Consistency
What I See Across the 4 Insights Tabs:

⚠️ Additional Calculation & Data Inconsistencies
10. All 125 Use Cases Stuck in "Foundation" Phase
What I See: Operating Model tab shows:

Foundation: 125 (100%)
Strategic: 0 (0%)
Transition: 0 (0%)
Steady State: 0 (0%)

What I Also See: Status Coverage shows:

Defined: 125
In Progress: 0
Deployed/Live: 0

The Problem: If TOM phase derivation uses useCaseStatus → mappedStatuses, and all use cases have status = "Defined" or "Discovery", they ALL map to Foundation. This means:

The TOM phase derivation is technically working
But the status field isn't being updated as use cases progress
OR the status-to-phase mapping is too coarse (multiple statuses map to Foundation)

Business Impact: The TOM dashboard is useless for tracking AI delivery progress if everything shows Foundation.

11. RAI Assessment Metrics Contradict Each Other
What I See:

Summary Cards: 117 Fully Assessed, 8 Partially Assessed, 0 Not Assessed
Customer Harm Risk Distribution: Low 9 + Medium 15 + High 5 = 29 assessed, 94 Unassessed

The Contradiction: How can 117 be "Fully Assessed" if Customer Harm Risk shows 94 unassessed?
Root Cause Hypothesis: The "Fully Assessed" calculation likely checks if ANY RAI field is filled (≥1 field), not ALL 5 fields. The field coverage shows:

Explainability: 118/125 (94%)
Customer Harm Risk: 125/125 (100%) ← But distribution shows 94 unassessed?
Human Accountability: 117/125 (94%)
Data Location: 117/125 (94%)
Third-Party Model: 117/125 (94%)

Possible Bug: The "125/125" for Customer Harm Risk might be counting use cases that have the field (even if null), not use cases with actual values.

12. Value Tier vs Quadrant Misalignment
What I See:

Value Tier Distribution: High 17, Medium 54, Low 0, Not Estimated 53 = 124 (missing 1?)
Value by Quadrant: Experimental 99 (£5.8M), Strategic Bet 22 (£4.8M), Watchlist 1 (£571K), Quick Win 3 (£519K) = 125

The Issue:

53 use cases have "No Value Data" but they're still assigned to quadrants
Quadrant assignment uses Impact/Effort scores, but Value Tier uses estimated £ value
These are two different classification systems being shown together

Logical Question: Should use cases without value estimates even appear in Value Realization insights? They inflate the quadrant counts without contributing real value data.

13. Capability Transition Aggregation Source Unclear
What I See:

Portfolio Independence: 10%
Staffing Split: 230.3 Hexaware / 98.7 Client FTE
KT Progress: 4/750

The Question: If capability_transition isn't auto-populated on use case creation (per finding #4), where is this aggregated data coming from?
Possibilities:

Someone manually ran "Derive All" at some point
A subset of use cases have manually-entered capability data
Default values are being aggregated (not real data)

Verification Needed: Check if the staffing curve chart reflects actual derived data or placeholder defaults.

14. Quadrant Distribution vs Governance Gates Paradox
What I See:

99 Experimental (Low Value, Low Effort)
22 Strategic Bet (High Value, High Effort)
3 Quick Win (High Value, Low Effort)
1 Watchlist (Low Value, High Effort)

The Paradox: Per governance logic, use cases need Intake & Prioritization gate (all 10 levers scored 1-5) to pass. But if 99 are "Experimental" (low scores on both axes), it means:

Either scoring levers ARE filled (gate should pass)
OR quadrant assignment works without complete scoring (gate logic mismatch)

Why This Matters: The Value Realization tab shows Reference Library (all use cases), but if these haven't passed gates, their value estimates shouldn't be treated as "portfolio value" in business terms.

🔧 Admin Setup Considerations
Based on the context bar showing "Hexaware > AI Strategy Initiative > Default > TOM: Hybrid (Locked)", I can infer the admin setup state:
15. Single Default Engagement for All Use Cases
What I See: All 125 use cases appear linked to "AI Strategy Initiative" engagement under "Hexaware" client.
The Issue: This is the seeded default engagement. For true multi-tenant operation:

Different clients should have their own engagements
Different engagements should have different TOM presets
The "Locked" status suggests TOM preset can't be changed mid-stream (good!)

But: If this is a demo/reference library, having all 125 use cases under one engagement makes sense. The question is: Is there a workflow to bulk-move use cases to a new engagement when creating a client-specific engagement?

16. TOM Preset "Hybrid" but All Phases Show Foundation Only
What I See: TOM preset is "Hybrid (Locked)" but the phase distribution shows only Foundation phase populated.
Expected for Hybrid Model: Should have multiple active phases representing different maturity levels across the portfolio.
What This Suggests: Either:

The Hybrid preset only defines Foundation phase
OR the phase configuration for Hybrid preset isn't correctly loaded
OR use case statuses don't map to other phases in this preset

Revised Implementation Plan
Phase 0 — Immediate Data/Bug Fixes (Before Multi-tenant)

Fix RAI calculation bug — Verify "Fully Assessed" logic counts use cases with ALL 5 fields vs ANY field
Verify Hybrid TOM preset phase definitions — Check if mappedStatuses for Strategic/Transition/Steady State are configured
Audit use case status distribution — Why are all 125 "Defined"? Should some be "In Progress" or "Deployed"?

Phase 1 — Critical Multi-tenant Fixes

Add governanceConfig, valueConfig, capabilityConfig to engagements
Extend getConfigsFromEngagement() for all config types
Refactor calculateGovernanceStatus() to read engagement config
Auto-enable TOM when engagement selects preset

Phase 2 — Calculation & Derivation Fixes

Auto-derive capability on use case create/update
Add "Derive All" for value estimation on engagement setup
Fix Value Tier calculation to exclude use cases without estimates
Clarify Active Portfolio vs Reference Library business logic

Phase 3 — UX & Architecture

Fix sequential gate display contradiction
Separate Governance Bodies from Use Case Gates in schema
Add bulk use case migration tool for new engagements
Add engagement-level KPI targets for Value Realization
