AUDIT REQUEST: Existing Insurance Taxonomy & Use Case Classification

I need to understand what taxonomy/classification already exists before proposing solutions. DO NOT make changes - only report findings.

=== PART 1: METADATA CONFIGURATION ===

1. List ALL classification-related arrays/fields in metadata_config:
   - processes[]
   - activities[]
   - linesOfBusiness[]
   - businessSegments[]
   - Any other categorization fields

2. For each, provide:
   - How many distinct values?
   - Sample values (first 10-15)
   - Are they hierarchical or flat?

=== PART 2: USE CASE SCHEMA ===

3. What classification fields exist on use_cases table?
   - List all fields that categorize/classify a use case
   - Which are single-select vs multi-select (arrays)?
   - Which are required vs optional?

4. For the 126 use cases, what's the population rate for each classification field?
   | Field | Populated Count | % | Sample Values |
   |-------|-----------------|---|---------------|

=== PART 3: CRUD MODAL CLASSIFICATION UI ===

5. In the CRUD Modal (CRUDUseCaseModal), which classification fields are exposed?
   - What dropdowns/selectors exist?
   - Are there any dependent/cascading dropdowns (e.g., selecting Process filters Activities)?
   - Screenshot or describe the Classification/Categorization section

6. Is there any existing mapping between:
   - Process → Activities?
   - Line of Business → Business Segments?
   - Any field → KPI applicability?

=== PART 4: EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS ===

7. Check metadata_config for any mapping configurations:
   - processActivities (process → activity mapping)?
   - Any domain → function mappings?
   - Any business function hierarchies?

8. Is there any existing connection between:
   - Use case classification → Scoring implications?
   - Use case classification → T-shirt sizing?
   - Use case classification → Value estimates?

=== PART 5: INSURANCE-SPECIFIC TAXONOMY ===

9. Looking at the actual data in processes[], activities[], linesOfBusiness[], businessSegments[]:
   - Are these insurance-specific categories?
   - Do they represent business functions (Claims, Underwriting, etc.)?
   - Could they be used for KPI library matching?

10. If processes[] or activities[] contain insurance business functions, list the mapping:
    | Process/Activity | Could Map To KPI Category |
    |------------------|---------------------------|
    | (e.g., "Claims Processing") | claims_triage |

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

## EXISTING TAXONOMY AUDIT

### Metadata Config Classification Fields
[List all with sample values]

### Use Case Classification Fields
[Table showing fields, types, population rates]

### CRUD Modal Classification UI
[Description of what user sees]

### Existing Mappings
[Any process→activity or other relationships]

### Insurance Business Function Coverage
[Assessment: Can existing fields be used for KPI matching?]

### Recommendation
[Can we reuse existing taxonomy for KPI library, or do we need additions?]
