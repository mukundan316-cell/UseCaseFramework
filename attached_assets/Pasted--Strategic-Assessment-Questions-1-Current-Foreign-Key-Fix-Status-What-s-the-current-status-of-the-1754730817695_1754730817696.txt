🔍 Strategic Assessment Questions
1. Current Foreign Key Fix Status
What's the current status of the foreign key constraint violations that were identified in the previous status check? Have these been resolved, and is the question/answer saving pipeline now working properly?
2. New Component Integration Test
Can you test one of the newly created LEGO blocks in the actual questionnaire flow? Try:
- Create a question template using 'currency' type with CurrencyInputLegoBlock
- Add it to a test section in the assessment
- Verify it renders and saves answers properly
- Test the complete flow: template → question → answer → database
3. Admin Panel Current State
Show me the current state of the Admin Panel Assessment Management tab. Specifically:
- Are the new question types ('currency', 'percentage_allocation', etc.) visible in the "Create Custom" modal?
- Can you successfully create question templates using the new question types?
- Do the new types appear in the filter dropdowns?
4. Implementation Readiness for Missing Components
Based on the patterns from the 4 LEGO blocks you've created, how long would it take to implement:
- BusinessLinesMatrixLegoBlock (table with premium percentages + growth trends)
- DepartmentSkillsMatrixLegoBlock (department skills matrix table)
Are there any technical challenges or dependencies I should know about?
5. RSA Questionnaire Import Strategy
What's the best approach to import the 100-question RSA questionnaire? Should we:
A) Use the existing QuestionTemplateLibraryLegoBlock bulk import feature?
B) Create a specialized import script?
C) Use the API endpoints directly?
What format would work best for the question data?
📊 Why These Questions Matter:

Question 2 - Validates that new components actually work in practice
Question 3 - Confirms admin panel integration is ready for content creation
Question 4 - Helps plan realistic timeline for 100% completion
Question 5 - Defines the strategy for actually implementing the RSA questionnaire
