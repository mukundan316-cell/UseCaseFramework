Excellent approach! Let me gather the current state information before we create the final prompt. Please provide me with the following information:

## **Information Needed About Current Implementation**

### **1. Current Quadrant Visualization Code**
Can you show me the current code that renders the quadrant matrix in the Explorer view? Specifically:
- How are the quadrants currently positioned (which is top-left, top-right, etc.)?
- What are the current axis labels (X and Y)?
- How is the `getQuadrant()` function currently implemented?

### **2. Current Scoring Calculation Implementation**
Can you show me:
- The actual scoring calculation function (likely in a utils file or similar)
- How Impact and Effort scores are currently calculated
- What levers/fields are being used in each calculation
- The current formula being applied

### **3. Database Schema for Scoring**
Do you have:
- A table for storing scoring configuration/weights?
- How are the 12 levers currently stored in the database?
- Is there a configuration table for the threshold value (currently 3.0)?

### **4. Existing LEGO Components for Scoring**
Can you confirm if these LEGO components exist:
- `ScoringLegoBlock` - does this handle the scoring inputs?
- `ScoringConfigurationLegoBlock` or similar for admin configuration?
- `ScoringDashboardLegoBlock` - how does this display scores?

### **5. Admin Panel Scoring Tab**
Can you show me:
- The current Admin panel's scoring configuration interface
- How lever weights are currently managed
- Whether weights can be adjusted or are hardcoded

### **6. Use Case Data Model**
What fields does a use case currently have for scoring? Please confirm if these exist:
- Revenue Impact, Cost Savings, Risk Reduction (Business Value)
- Data Readiness, Technical Complexity, Change Impact (Feasibility)
- Explainability & Bias, Regulatory Compliance (AI Governance)
- Any other scoring-related fields

### **7. Matrix Component Structure**
Is the matrix visualization:
- An SVG component?
- A Canvas element?
- A third-party charting library?
- A custom React component?

### **8. Current Quadrant Assignment Logic**
Can you show me where use cases are assigned to quadrants? Is this:
- Calculated on the frontend in real-time?
- Stored in the database?
- Calculated via API endpoint?

### **9. Explorer Filter Implementation**
How does the Explorer currently filter by quadrant? Can you show:
- The filter component code
- How quadrant filtering is applied to the use case list

### **10. Any Error Messages or Console Warnings**
Are there any current error messages or warnings related to:
- Quadrant assignment
- Scoring calculations
- Matrix visualization

Once you provide this information, I can create a precise incremental prompt that:
- Only creates what doesn't exist
- Modifies only what needs fixing
- Reuses all existing LEGO components
- Maintains database persistence patterns
- Ensures no regression of existing functionality

This way, we'll have a surgical fix rather than potentially breaking working code!
