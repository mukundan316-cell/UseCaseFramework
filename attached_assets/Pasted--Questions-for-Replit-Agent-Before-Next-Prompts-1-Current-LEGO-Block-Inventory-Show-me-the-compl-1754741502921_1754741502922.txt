🔍 Questions for Replit Agent Before Next Prompts:
1. Current LEGO Block Inventory
Show me the complete list of currently implemented LEGO blocks in /client/src/components/lego-blocks/ directory. For each block, provide:
- Component name
- Purpose/functionality 
- Props interface
- Current usage/integration status

I need to understand what building blocks we already have before creating new ones.
2. Question Type Support Analysis
List all currently supported question types in:
- QuestionRegistryLegoBlock mapping
- Database schema (question_type enum)
- Shared schema validation

Show me which question types are fully implemented vs. partially implemented vs. missing entirely.
3. Remaining RSA Sections Overview
Based on the RSA questionnaire document, we need to build 5 more sections:

Section 2: Current AI & Data Capabilities (Questions 18-52) - 35 questions
Section 3: Use Case Discovery & Validation (Questions 53-60) - 8 questions  
Section 4: Technology & Infrastructure Readiness (Questions 61-80) - 20 questions
Section 5: People, Process & Change Management (Questions 81-90) - 10 questions
Section 6: Regulatory, Compliance & Ethics (Questions 91-100) - 10 questions

For each section, identify which question types/patterns appear most frequently so we can prioritize LEGO block development.
4. Reusability Assessment
From your analysis of the RSA document, which question patterns can we handle with EXISTING LEGO blocks vs. need NEW blocks?

Categorize questions into:
- ✅ Can reuse existing blocks (text, smart_rating, select, multi_choice)
- 🔄 Need minor modifications to existing blocks
- ❌ Need completely new LEGO blocks

This will help us build efficiently without duplicating functionality.
🎯 Why This Analysis Matters:
Before building 80+ more questions, we should:
Maximize Reuse:

Text inputs - Can handle most open-ended questions
Smart rating - Can handle most 1-5 scale questions
Multi-select - Can handle checkbox questions
Company profile pattern - Can be template for other compound questions

Identify Gaps:

New question types actually needed
Modifications to existing blocks required
Compound question patterns that need templates

Strategic Building:

Build once, use many times
Focus on high-impact, reusable components
Avoid creating single-use LEGO blocks

Once we have this analysis, I can provide precise, targeted prompts that maximize reuse and minimize new development while ensuring we can handle all 100 RSA questions efficiently.
