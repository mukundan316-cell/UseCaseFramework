Yes, it would be helpful to check the current implementation status. Here are some key questions to ask Replit Agent:

## **Implementation Status Check Questions:**

### **1. Component Creation Verification**
```
Show me the file structure of the new LEGO blocks created so far. List the files in /client/src/components/lego-blocks/ and confirm which of these are newly created:
- SmartRatingLegoBlock.tsx
- RankingLegoBlock.tsx  
- CurrencyInputLegoBlock.tsx
- PercentageAllocationLegoBlock.tsx
```

### **2. Database Schema Status**
```
What is the current status of the database schema updates? Show me:
- The updated question_type enum values in the database schema
- Any migration files created
- Current state of /server/db/schema.ts regarding new question types
```

### **3. Component Interface Verification**
```
For each new LEGO block created, show me the TypeScript interfaces/props definitions. Specifically:
- What props does each component accept?
- Are the interfaces exported separately?
- Do they follow the existing LEGO block patterns?
```

### **4. QuestionRegistryLegoBlock Integration Status**
```
Has QuestionRegistryLegoBlock been updated to map the new question types? Show me:
- The current question type mapping in the component
- Which new question types are integrated
- Any imports added for the new LEGO blocks
```

### **5. Compilation and Error Status**
```
Are there any TypeScript compilation errors or runtime errors with the new components? 
- Run the project and check for any errors
- Verify all imports and exports are working
- Check if existing functionality still works
```

### **6. API Endpoint Status** 
```
What's the current state of API endpoint updates for handling new question types?
- Have validation schemas been updated in /server/lib/validation.ts?
- Are there any changes to questionnaire-related API routes?
- Can the backend handle JSON-based answers for complex question types?
```

### **7. Integration Test**
```
Can you test adding a new question template using one of the new question types through the Admin Panel? Try:
- Creating a template with 'smart_rating' type
- Saving it through the QuestionTemplateLibraryLegoBlock interface
- Verify it appears in the template library
```

## **Critical Issues to Check:**

### **8. Backward Compatibility**
```
Verify that existing functionality still works:
- Can you still create use cases in the CRUDUseCaseModal?
- Does the existing assessment flow still work with current question types?
- Are there any broken imports or missing dependencies?
```

### **9. Component Isolation**
```
Confirm that the new LEGO blocks are truly reusable:
- Do they work without hardcoded data?
- Do they handle empty/null props gracefully?
- Are they following the existing LEGO patterns from other blocks?
```

### **10. Next Steps Readiness**
```
What's needed to proceed with the remaining prompts (8-12)?
- Are there any dependencies or prerequisites missing?
- Any structural issues that need to be resolved first?
- What's the current state of the project build/compilation?
```

These questions will help identify:
- ✅ What's been successfully implemented
- ⚠️ What needs fixes or adjustments  
- 🚫 What's blocking progress on remaining prompts
- 🔄 What should be prioritized next

This status check is crucial before proceeding with the Admin Panel integration and API updates in the remaining prompts.
