# Metadata-Driven T-Shirt Sizing Framework for RSA

Based on your sophisticated existing framework and the need for flexibility without hard-coding, here's a comprehensive **metadata-driven approach** that captures the lowest grain and builds up to accurate, configurable T-shirt sizing.

## Core Architecture: Configuration-First Design

### **1. Metadata Schema Foundation**

The system uses **five core configuration tables** that eliminate all hard-coded values:

**Core Configuration Tables:**
- `tshirt_sizing_config`: Size definitions, colors, descriptions
- `role_rates`: Market-based daily rates by role and geography  
- `team_composition_templates`: FTE allocation per role by T-shirt size
- `mapping_rules`: Dynamic rules engine for size assignment
- `roi_parameters`: Configurable benefit multipliers and discount rates

### **2. Granular Cost Calculation Engine**

**Formula**: `Role × Rate × Duration × Team Size × Overhead`

**Sample Calculation for RSA 'M' Size Project:**
- Base daily team cost: £1,830
- Overhead multiplier: 1.56 (includes benefits, facilities, management, risk buffer)
- Total daily cost: £2,853  
- 12-week project cost: £171,206

**UK Market Rates (Configurable):**
- Developer: £400/day
- Analyst: £350/day  
- PM: £500/day
- Architect: £600/day
- AI Specialist: £650/day

### **3. Dynamic Mapping Rules Engine**

Replace hard-coded thresholds with **priority-based rules**:

**Sample Rules for RSA:**
1. **Quick Win Rule**: Impact 2.5-4.0, Effort <2.5 → Size S (Priority 100)
2. **Strategic Bet Rule**: Impact 3.5-5.0, Effort 2.5-4.0 → Size L (Priority 200)  
3. **Effort Adjustment Rule**: Any project with Effort >4.0 → +1 Size (Priority 300)

### **4. Flexible ROI Parameters**

**Configurable Annual Benefit Multipliers:**
- Revenue Impact: £75,000 per scoring point
- Cost Savings: £60,000 per scoring point
- Risk Reduction: £50,000 per scoring point
- Strategic Fit: £40,000 per scoring point
- Broker Experience: £30,000 per scoring point

**Project-Type Discount Rates:**
- Quick Win: 8.0%
- Strategic: 10.0% 
- Experimental: 12.0%
- Infrastructure: 6.0%

## Admin Interface Features

### **User-Friendly Configuration Panels:**

1. **T-Shirt Size Management**
   - Drag-and-drop size ordering
   - Color picker for visualization
   - Real-time impact preview on existing use cases
   - Bulk enable/disable capabilities

2. **Cost Configuration**
   - Role rate management by geography
   - Team composition templates
   - Overhead factor calculator with breakdown
   - Historical cost accuracy tracking

3. **Mapping Rules Engine**
   - Visual rule builder with drag-and-drop conditions
   - Rule conflict detection and warnings
   - A/B testing for rule effectiveness
   - Bulk import/export via Excel

4. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Estimation accuracy over time
   - Cost variance analysis by size
   - ROI prediction confidence intervals
   - Industry benchmark comparisons

## Self-Improving System

### **Automatic Calibration:**
```sql
-- Auto-calibration based on actual outcomes
WITH accuracy_analysis AS (
  SELECT 
    tshirt_size,
    AVG(actual_cost / estimated_cost_max) as cost_accuracy_factor,
    AVG(actual_weeks / estimated_weeks_max) as time_accuracy_factor
  FROM estimation_accuracy ea
  JOIN use_cases uc ON ea.use_case_id = uc.meaningful_id
  WHERE ea.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months'
  GROUP BY tshirt_size
)
UPDATE role_rates 
SET daily_rate_gbp = daily_rate_gbp * accuracy_analysis.cost_accuracy_factor;
```
