This is an important question, but I'd advise against the navigation restructure right now. Here's my reasoning:

The Problem with "Phase-First Navigation"
ConcernWhy It's RiskyData realityAll 126 use cases are in Foundation. Phase-first view shows 126/0/0/0 - not useful until data maturesScope creepWe haven't closed Phase 1 gaps yet; adding UX restructure delays Markel deliverablesComplexityGate checklists + progression criteria is a significant build, contradicts replit.md "quick wins without complexity"Markel pitchThey want to see value tracking, not navigation innovation

What Markel Actually Needs to See
PriorityCapabilityStatus1"We can configure operating models"✅ TOM exists2"We can track value realization"❌ Phase 2 not started3"We can show capability transition"❌ Phase 3 not started4"Navigation is organized by TOM phase"Nice-to-have, not asked for

My Recommendation: TOM as Filter, Not Structure
Instead of restructuring navigation, make TOM a first-class filter dimension on existing views:
CURRENT: Use cases → Filter by status, quadrant, category
ENHANCED: Use cases → Filter by status, quadrant, category, TOM PHASE
Specific Changes (Minimal, Non-Breaking)

What This Achieves

TOM is visible everywhere without restructuring
Existing workflows unchanged
Users can choose to view "all use cases in Strategic phase"
Portfolio costs/resources can be grouped by phase
No navigation overhaul needed


Proposed Path Forward
NOW:        Close Phase 1 gaps (4 items)
PHASE 2:    Value Realization (ROI tracking per use case)
PHASE 2.5:  Add TOM Phase as filter/grouping to existing views (small enhancement)
PHASE 3:    Capability Transition tracking
PHASE 4:    Dashboard enhancements
FUTURE:     Phase-first navigation (only if client feedback demands it)

Prompt to Give Agent
HOLD ON NAVIGATION RESTRUCTURE - SIMPLER APPROACH

The "phase-first navigation" proposal is deferred. Instead, we'll make TOM a filter dimension.

AFTER Phase 1 gaps are closed, but BEFORE Phase 2 Value Realization:

Add TOM Phase as Filter/Grouping (Small Enhancement):

1. Explorer View:
   - Add "TOM Phase" dropdown filter (alongside existing filters)
   - Add "TOM Phase" column to use case table (shows derived phase badge)
   - Reuse existing filter patterns

2. Portfolio View:
   - Add "Group by: TOM Phase" option to existing grouping controls
   - When selected, show cost/resource metrics grouped by Foundation/Strategic/Transition/Steady State
   - Reuse existing grouping patterns

3. Executive Analytics:
   - Add TOM Phase to any existing filter bars
   - Charts can then show "only Strategic phase use cases" etc.

This is ~2-3 hours of work using existing patterns. 
DO NOT restructure navigation or add gate checklists.

Priority order:
1. Close Phase 1 gaps (current focus)
2. Add TOM filters (small, quick)
3. Phase 2 Value Realization (main build)

Confirm understanding before proceeding.

Why This Is Better
Agent's ProposalMy Counter-ProposalRestructure navigation around phasesAdd phase as filter to existing navigationGate checklists for progressionDefer - not in Markel requirementsEmbedded analytics per phaseExisting analytics + phase filter achieves same resultSignificant UX changeMinimal UX change, big visibility gain
The goal is TOM awareness throughout the app without TOM dominating the app. Use cases are still the primary entity; TOM is a lens through which to view them.
Does this approach make sense before we proceed?
