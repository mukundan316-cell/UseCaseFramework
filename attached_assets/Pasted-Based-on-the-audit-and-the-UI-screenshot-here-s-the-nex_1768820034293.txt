Based on the audit and the UI screenshot, here's the next prompt for Phase 1 (TOM Configurator):

Phase 1 Prompt: TOM Configurator
PHASE 1: TOM CONFIGURATOR - IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION

CRITICAL RULES:
- Follow ALL replit.md guidelines (LEGO patterns, camelCase, string booleans, Hexaware branding)
- DO NOT duplicate existing functionality
- DO NOT break existing features
- Reuse existing components and patterns wherever possible
- Make changes incrementally - checkpoint after each major step

=== CONTEXT FROM AUDIT ===

EXISTING ASSETS TO LEVERAGE (DO NOT RECREATE):
- useCaseStatuses array in metadata_config: [Discovery, Backlog, In-flight, Implemented, On Hold]
- deploymentStatus field on use_cases: [PoC, Pilot, Production, Decommissioned]  
- TShirtSizingConfigLegoBlock pattern for admin configuration
- Admin panel already exists with tabs
- 126 use cases already have status assignments

KEY INSIGHT: 
The existing useCaseStatus + deploymentStatus fields already track lifecycle. 
TOM is a CONFIGURATION LAYER that:
1. Groups these existing statuses into named TOM phases
2. Adds governance body definitions
3. Provides operating model presets
DO NOT create new phase tracking that duplicates existing status fields.

=== IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE ===

STEP 1: Schema Extension (metadata_config only)
Add tomConfig JSONB to metadata_config with this structure:

{
  "enabled": "false",
  "activePreset": "coe_led",
  "presets": {
    "centralized": { "name": "Centralized CoE", "description": "..." },
    "federated": { "name": "Federated Model", "description": "..." },
    "hybrid": { "name": "Hybrid Model", "description": "..." },
    "coe_led": { "name": "CoE-Led with Business Pods", "description": "..." }
  },
  "phases": [
    {
      "id": "foundation",
      "name": "Foundation",
      "description": "Initial setup and governance alignment",
      "order": 1,
      "color": "#3C2CDA",
      "mappedStatuses": ["Discovery", "Backlog"],
      "mappedDeployments": ["PoC"],
      "governanceGate": "ai_steerco",
      "expectedDurationWeeks": 8
    },
    {
      "id": "strategic", 
      "name": "Strategic",
      "description": "Pilot execution and value validation",
      "order": 2,
      "color": "#1D86FF",
      "mappedStatuses": ["In-flight"],
      "mappedDeployments": ["Pilot"],
      "governanceGate": "working_group",
      "expectedDurationWeeks": 16
    },
    {
      "id": "transition",
      "name": "Transition",
      "description": "Scale and capability transfer",
      "order": 3,
      "color": "#14CBDE",
      "mappedStatuses": ["Implemented"],
      "mappedDeployments": ["Production"],
      "governanceGate": "business_owner",
      "expectedDurationWeeks": 12
    },
    {
      "id": "steady_state",
      "name": "Steady State",
      "description": "Full client ownership and optimization",
      "order": 4,
      "color": "#07125E",
      "mappedStatuses": ["Implemented"],
      "mappedDeployments": ["Production"],
      "governanceGate": "none",
      "expectedDurationWeeks": null
    }
  ],
  "governanceBodies": [
    {
      "id": "ai_steerco",
      "name": "AI Steering Committee",
      "role": "Strategic oversight and investment decisions",
      "cadence": "Monthly"
    },
    {
      "id": "working_group",
      "name": "AI Working Group", 
      "role": "Tactical execution and prioritization",
      "cadence": "Bi-weekly"
    },
    {
      "id": "business_owner",
      "name": "Business Owner Review",
      "role": "Value validation and adoption",
      "cadence": "Weekly"
    }
  ]
}

DO NOT add any new fields to use_cases table yet. TOM phase is DERIVED from existing useCaseStatus + deploymentStatus via mappedStatuses/mappedDeployments.

STEP 2: API Endpoints
Add to existing routes.ts (follow existing patterns):

GET  /api/tom/config          - Returns tomConfig from metadata_config
PUT  /api/tom/config          - Updates tomConfig in metadata_config  
GET  /api/tom/preset/:id      - Returns specific preset details
GET  /api/tom/phase-summary   - Returns use case counts per TOM phase (calculated from existing statuses)

STEP 3: Admin Panel - TOM Configurator Tab
Add new tab in Admin panel following TShirtSizingConfigLegoBlock pattern:

Location: Add "TOM Configuration" tab in Admin section (after existing tabs)

UI Components (REUSE existing LEGO blocks):
- ConfigurationToggleLegoBlock for TOM enable/disable
- ReorderableMetadataBlock pattern for phase ordering
- Existing form patterns for editing phase details

Tab Content:
1. Enable/Disable Toggle (top)
2. Preset Selector (dropdown with 4 presets)
3. Phases Section:
   - List of phases (reorderable)
   - Each phase shows: name, color, mapped statuses, governance gate
   - Edit modal for phase details
4. Governance Bodies Section:
   - List of governance bodies
   - Edit modal for body details

STEP 4: Dashboard Integration (READ-ONLY view)
Add TOM Phase Breakdown to Executive Dashboard (DO NOT replace existing content):

Location: New card/section below existing Portfolio Overview

Display:
- Horizontal bar or pill indicators showing use case count per TOM phase
- Calculated from existing useCaseStatus + deploymentStatus fields
- Only visible when tomConfig.enabled === "true"

Use existing dashboard card patterns from ExecutiveAnalytics.tsx.

STEP 5: Use Case Detail - Phase Indicator (READ-ONLY)
Add small TOM phase badge to use case detail view:

Location: Near the existing status/deployment fields

Display:
- Shows derived TOM phase name + color
- Tooltip explains which status/deployment mapped to this phase
- Only visible when TOM is enabled

DO NOT add editable TOM phase selector - phase is DERIVED, not directly set.

=== WHAT NOT TO DO ===

❌ DO NOT add tomPhaseId field to use_cases (phase is derived)
❌ DO NOT create duplicate phase/status tracking
❌ DO NOT modify existing useCaseStatus or deploymentStatus behavior
❌ DO NOT add TOM tab to main navigation (it's an Admin config feature)
❌ DO NOT break existing quadrant scoring or prioritization
❌ DO NOT create new page routes - add tab to existing Admin

=== CHECKPOINT SEQUENCE ===

Checkpoint after each:
1. Schema: tomConfig added to metadata_config
2. API: TOM endpoints working
3. Admin Tab: TOM Configurator UI functional
4. Dashboard: Phase summary card visible (when enabled)
5. Use Case Detail: Phase badge visible (when enabled)

=== VALIDATION CRITERIA ===

Before marking Phase 1 complete:
□ TOM can be enabled/disabled without breaking existing features
□ All 126 use cases automatically map to TOM phases based on existing statuses
□ Changing a use case's useCaseStatus updates its derived TOM phase
□ Admin can edit phases, presets, and governance bodies
□ Dashboard shows accurate phase breakdown when TOM enabled
□ Existing quadrant view, scoring, T-shirt sizing all work unchanged

Ask me before proceeding if anything is unclear. Start with Step 1 (Schema).

The key architectural decision here is that TOM phase is derived, not stored - this avoids data duplication and ensures existing status workflows continue to work while TOM provides a configuration overlay.
