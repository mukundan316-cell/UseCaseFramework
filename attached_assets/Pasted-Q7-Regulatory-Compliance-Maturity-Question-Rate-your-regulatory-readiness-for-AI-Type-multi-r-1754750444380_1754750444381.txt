Implementation Requirements:

Both questions optional (is_required: false)
Question order: Q6 = order 6, Q7 = order 7
Section: Business Strategy & AI Vision (section_id: existing section 1)
Mandatory: Include "Additional Context & Notes" textbox for every question
Use existing LEGO blocks: CompanyProfileLegoBlock (Q6) and MultiRatingLegoBlock (Q7)
Professional help text with RSA regulatory context
Test that both questions display properly and integrate with existing Q1-Q5

Expected Result:
Section 1 will have 7 complete questions (Q1-Q7) covering the full Business Strategy & AI Vision scope with professional stakeholder interview format.

## **🎯 Why This Approach Works:**

### **Q6 - Geographic Operations:**
- ✅ **Reuses CompanyProfileLegoBlock** (same as Q1)
- ✅ **Multiple input types** (text, percentage, select, number)
- ✅ **Professional layout** for executive discussions
- ✅ **Notes section** for regulatory insights

### **Q7 - Regulatory Compliance Maturity:**
- ✅ **Reuses MultiRatingLegoBlock** (same as Q5)
- ✅ **Multi-dimensional assessment** (3 regulatory areas)
- ✅ **1-5 scale with descriptive labels**
- ✅ **Notes section** for compliance gaps

### **Consistent Pattern:**
- Both questions follow the established Section 1 pattern
- Professional stakeholder interview format
- Optional questions with rich qualitative capture
- RSA regulatory and geographic context

Once Q6-Q7 are implemented, **Section 1 will be 100% complete** with 7 questions covering the full Business Strategy & AI Vision scope! 🚀
