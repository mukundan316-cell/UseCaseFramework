Leveraging Microsoft’s Power Platform—including Power Automate, Power BI, Copilot Studio, and SharePoint—the framework will automate requirement management processes, ensuring improved efficiency, traceability, and adherence to standards. Designed as an IP-free solution, it integrates seamlessly with existing organisational methodologies and supports both legacy and change platforms. The framework offers a centralised hub where best-of-breed tools can be plugged in and invoked, with automated updates to Jira and test management systems. Key value propositions include standardisation across processes, artefacts, execution, and reporting; end-to-end traceability throughout design, build, test, and release phases; and enhanced transparency via accurate dashboards and reporting tools like Jira, XRAY, and TestNG. It also promises improved product quality through comprehensive user stories, test cases, and automation, and increased delivery velocity by harnessing AI capabilities embedded in the Power Platform. This initiative positions organisations to modernise their SDLC with a scalable, intelligent, and integrated approach.", "function": "Chief Information Office", "risks_to_customers,_third_parties,_staff": "Implementing a Gen AI-powered accelerator framework for SDLC presents some organisational risks, but our proposed approach significantly mitigates them. Since the framework does not involve customer data directly, concerns around external data privacy are minimised. The integration is modular and accessed only when specific functionality is required, reducing exposure and complexity. However, risks remain around third-party tool compatibility, dependency management, and ensuring secure integration practices. Internally, staff may require clear communication and upskilling. To address these, the framework will be governed by robust access controls, compliance protocols, and a disciplined rollout aligned with organisational standards.", "risks_to_rsa": "Implementing a Gen AI-powered accelerator framework for SDLC may pose risks to RSA such as integration complexity, potential misalignment with existing governance structures, and the need for staff reskilling due to automation. However, the framework is specifically designed to minimise these risks. It uses a modular approach, allowing integrations to be accessed only when specific functionality is required. Additionally, the framework supports the organisation’s transition to responsible AI by embedding governance, access controls, and compliance protocols from the outset, ensuring a secure, transparent, and disciplined implementation.", "what_data_is_used_in_this_ai?": "The proposed solution uses only user identity data (internal authorised staff) —specifically email addresses and Entra ID—which are already securely implemented within RSA.
