Prompt 9: Create Assessment-to-UseCase Bridge
Connect assessment results to use cases:

1. Add recommended_by_assessment field to use_cases table
2. Create API endpoint: POST /api/assessments/:id/recommendations
   - Analyze assessment scores
   - Match to relevant use cases based on maturity gaps
   - Mark use cases as recommended

3. On matrix plot, highlight recommended use cases with glow effect
4. Add filter: "Show Assessment Recommendations"

This bridges questionnaire insights to actionable use cases.
No new components needed - enhance existing matrix plot.
Prompt 10: Add Progress Persistence
Implement auto-save and progress recovery:

1. Save answers to database on every change (debounced 1 second)
2. On page reload, restore previous answers
3. Add "Save & Exit" button to preserve progress
4. Show "last saved" timestamp
5. Add resume capability from dashboard

Use existing database connection. Follow patterns from use case form.
Store in questionnaire_responses and question_answers tables.
Prompt 11: Build ResponseExportLegoBlock
Create export functionality for completed assessments:

Location: client/src/components/lego-blocks/ResponseExportLegoBlock.tsx

Features:
- Export as PDF/Excel/JSON dropdown button
- Include assessment scores and recommendations
- Use existing Download icon button pattern
- Call API endpoint: GET /api/responses/:id/export?format=pdf

Reuse existing DataActionCard patterns for styling.
Make it reusable - can be placed anywhere.
Prompt 12: Create Assessment Results View
Build comprehensive results dashboard:

1. Use ScoringDashboardLegoBlock for maturity scores
2. Add recommendations list with priority levels
3. Show gap analysis with target vs current state
4. Include "Generate Report" using ResponseExportLegoBlock
5. Add "Retake Assessment" option

Place in AssessmentView when status is 'complete'.
Reuse existing card and layout patterns.
All data from API - no hardcoding.
