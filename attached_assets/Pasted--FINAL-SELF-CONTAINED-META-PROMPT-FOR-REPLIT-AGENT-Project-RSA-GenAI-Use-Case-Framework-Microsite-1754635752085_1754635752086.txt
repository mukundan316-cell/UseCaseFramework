✅ FINAL SELF-CONTAINED META-PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT
Project: RSA GenAI Use Case Framework Microsite
Type: Modular, extensible microsite for AI use case evaluation and prioritization
You are a Replit Agent tasked with building a modern, modular, extensible microsite for RSA Insurance to evaluate, score, and prioritize AI/GenAI use cases across the insurance value chain.

🎯 GOALS:
1. Capture and manage AI/GenAI use cases with business metadata.
2. Score each use case based on business impact and implementation feasibility.
3. Visualize them in a dynamic 2×2 prioritization matrix.
4. Filter use cases by insurance-specific dimensions.
5. Enable dynamic editing of filter categories via an admin interface.
6. Architect the app for future extensibility using modular, LEGO-style design.

🧠 CORE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS:

### 1. 📥 USE CASE SUBMISSION FORM
A form to capture and score new AI use cases with the following fields:

**Metadata Dropdowns:**
- `value_chain_component`: e.g., Underwriting, Claims, Policy Servicing, Distribution, Product Development, IT Ops, Fraud/Compliance, Customer Service
- `process`: e.g., Quote & Bind, FNOL, Pricing, Renewal, Subrogation
- `line_of_business`: e.g., Auto, Property, Marine, Life, Cyber, Specialty
- `business_segment`: e.g., Mid-Market, Large Commercial, SME, E&S
- `geography`: e.g., UK, Europe, Global, North America
- `use_case_type`: e.g., GenAI, Predictive ML, NLP, RPA

**Scoring Sliders (1–5):**
- **Impact Levers**:
  - `revenue_impact`
  - `cost_savings`
  - `risk_reduction`
  - `strategic_fit`
- **Feasibility Levers**:
  - `data_readiness`
  - `technical_complexity`
  - `change_impact`
  - `adoption_readiness`

**Scoring Logic (explicitly included in the code):**
```javascript
impact_score = (revenue_impact + cost_savings + risk_reduction + strategic_fit) / 4
effort_score = (data_readiness + technical_complexity + change_impact + adoption_readiness) / 4
Quadrant Assignment Logic:
if (impact_score >= 4 && effort_score <= 2.5) quadrant = "Quick Win"
else if (impact_score >= 4 && effort_score > 2.5) quadrant = "Strategic Bet"
else if (impact_score < 4 && effort_score <= 2.5) quadrant = "Experimental"
else quadrant = "Watchlist"

2. 📊 2x2 MATRIX VISUALIZATION
•	Uses Recharts or Plotly
•	X-axis = Effort Score (inverted: lower effort → left)
•	Y-axis = Impact Score (higher impact → top)
•	Each use case plotted as a dot with:
o	Tooltip: title, quadrant, metadata
o	Optional color by business segment or LOB
•	Quadrants auto-labeled:
o	Top Left: Quick Win
o	Top Right: Strategic Bet
o	Bottom Left: Experimental
o	Bottom Right: Watchlist
________________________________________
3. 🧾 USE CASE EXPLORER
•	Card/grid layout of all use cases
•	Filter panel includes:
o	Value Chain Component
o	Process
o	Line of Business
o	Business Segment
o	Geography
o	Use Case Type
o	Quadrant
•	Search bar (filter by title or description)
•	Sort by impact or creation date
________________________________________
4. ⚙️ ADMIN PANEL (METADATA MANAGER)
•	Dynamic add/edit/delete for:
o	Value chain components
o	Processes
o	LOBs
o	Business segments
o	Geographies
o	Use case types
•	Option to import/export filters and use cases as JSON
•	Reset to default button
•	All metadata stored in localStorage or SQLite (as JSON)
________________________________________
5. 📚 PRELOADED SAMPLE USE CASES
Include at least 5 use cases across the insurance value chain:
Example:
{
  "title": "Automated FNOL Summarization",
  "description": "Summarizes first notice of loss narratives using GenAI for faster triage.",
  "value_chain_component": "Claims",
  "process": "FNOL",
  "line_of_business": "Auto",
  "business_segment": "Mid-Market",
  "geography": "UK",
  "use_case_type": "GenAI",
  "revenue_impact": 4,
  "cost_savings": 5,
  "risk_reduction": 4,
  "strategic_fit": 5,
  "data_readiness": 4,
  "technical_complexity": 2,
  "change_impact": 2,
  "adoption_readiness": 4
}
Auto-calculated:
•	impact_score: 4.5
•	effort_score: 3.0
•	quadrant: Strategic Bet
Repeat similarly for use cases in Underwriting, Distribution, Policy Servicing, and Fraud.

6. 🧱 LEGO-STYLE ARCHITECTURE
Design all components as modular React units:
•	/components/UseCaseForm
•	/components/MatrixPlot
•	/components/Explorer
•	/components/AdminPanel
•	/data/usecases.json
•	/data/filters.json
•	/services/useCaseStore.js
All use cases and filters should share a single global data store. Future tabs can be plugged in without modifying existing logic. Examples:
•	AI Maturity Scorecard
•	Partner Capability Evaluator
•	Use Case ROI Calculator
________________________________________
🧑‍💻 TECH STACK:
•	Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
•	Visualization: Recharts or Plotly
•	Storage: localStorage for MVP; design for optional SQLite upgrade
•	State: Context API or Zustand
•	Responsive Layout: Tablet and desktop
•	Styling Theme:
o	Primary Blue: #005DAA
o	Background: #F7F8F9
o	Cards: White, soft shadow, 2xl rounded
________________________________________
📁 FILE STRUCTURE:
•	/components
•	/data
•	/services
•	App.jsx
•	usecases.json & filters.json stored locally
________________________________________
🧪 OPTIONAL FEATURES:
•	Tooltip for each slider (info icon with hint)
•	Export use case list to CSV
•	Color-coded quadrant legend below matrix
________________________________________
🎯 FINAL DELIVERABLE:
A complete, working microsite that:
•	Captures use cases with rich metadata
•	Scores and classifies use cases into quadrants
•	Allows full filter-based exploration
•	Supports editable metadata taxonomies
•	Is modular and easily extendable in future
Do not rely on any external files or documents. All knowledge and use cases must be included and embedded within this prompt and scaffold.
