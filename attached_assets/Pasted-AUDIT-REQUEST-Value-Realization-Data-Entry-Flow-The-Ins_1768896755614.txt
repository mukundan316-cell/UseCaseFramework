AUDIT REQUEST: Value Realization Data Entry Flow

The Insights > Value Realization view exists but shows £0. I need to understand:

=== PART 1: USE CASE VALUE ENTRY ===

1. In the CRUD Modal (CRUDUseCaseModal), is there a Value Realization tab or section?
   - If yes, screenshot or describe what fields are available
   - If no, where is value data supposed to be entered?

2. What fields exist on use_cases.valueRealization JSONB?
   - Is any use case currently populated with value data?
   - Query: SELECT id, title, "valueRealization" FROM use_cases WHERE "valueRealization" IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5

3. Is there an API endpoint for updating use case value data?
   - PUT /api/use-cases/:id/value ?
   - How does it work?

=== PART 2: KPI BENCHMARKS ===

4. In the KPI Library (Admin > System > KPI Library Management):
   - Click "Show Details" on one KPI (e.g., Cycle Time Reduction)
   - What benchmark values are configured?
   - Are there actual baseline numbers (e.g., $125/claim) or just maturity rules?

5. How does process-to-KPI mapping work?
   - When a use case has processes[] = ["Claims Management"], which KPIs are suggested?
   - Is this automatic or manual selection?

=== PART 3: VALUE CALCULATION ===

6. How does the system convert KPI improvements to monetary value?
   - Is there a formula configured?
   - Example: If Cycle Time improves 40%, how does that become £X?

7. What enterprise metrics are calculated?
   - Total Investment: Sum of all use case investments?
   - Cumulative Value: Sum of what exactly?
   - Portfolio ROI: Formula?

=== PART 4: SAMPLE DATA ===

8. To demonstrate the platform, we need sample value data.
   - Can you populate 5-10 use cases with realistic value data?
   - Use the existing benchmarks from VALUE_FRAMEWORK_GUIDE.md

=== OUTPUT ===

Provide:
1. Description of current value entry UX
2. Screenshot of KPI benchmark details
3. Explanation of value calculation logic
4. Recommendation for sample data population
