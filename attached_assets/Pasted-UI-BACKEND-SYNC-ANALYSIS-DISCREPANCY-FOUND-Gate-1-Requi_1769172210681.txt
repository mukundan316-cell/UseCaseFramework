UI/BACKEND SYNC ANALYSIS
⚠️ DISCREPANCY FOUND: Gate 1 Requirements
RequirementBackend (Just Implemented)UI Guide (Screenshot 2)UI Form (Screenshot 1)Primary Business Owner✅ Required✅ Shows "Requires: Primary Business Owner"✅ Has "Gate Required" badgeBusiness Function✅ Required❌ NOT SHOWN❌ No "Gate Required" badgeStatus ≠ Discovery✅ Required❌ NOT SHOWN❌ No indication
What the UI Currently Shows (Image 2 - Guide):
GATE 1: Operating Model (Accountability)
Requires: Primary Business Owner
"Every AI needs a named owner"
What the UI Should Show After Backend Update:
GATE 1: Operating Model (Accountability)
Requires: 
- Primary Business Owner
- Business Function assigned
- Status beyond Discovery
"Accountability and organizational alignment before AI work begins"

SEND TO REPLIT AGENT
Please update the UI components to sync with the backend governance enforcement implementation. Here are the specific changes needed:
Task 1: Update Gate 1 Display in Guide Component
File: Likely client/src/components/lego-blocks/GovernanceGuideLegoBlock.tsx or similar
Current Text:
GATE 1: Operating Model (Accountability)
Requires: Primary Business Owner
"Every AI needs a named owner"
Update To:
GATE 1: Operating Model (Accountability)
Requires:
- Primary Business Owner
- Business Function
- Status beyond Discovery
"Accountability and organizational alignment must be established before AI work begins"

Task 2: Add "Gate Required" Badge to Business Function Field
File: The CRUD modal component (likely client/src/components/UseCaseCrudModal.tsx or in lego-blocks)
Current: Business Function dropdown has no badge
Update: Add the same "Gate Required" badge that Primary Business Owner has
tsx// Current (approximate)
<Label>Business Function</Label>
<Select ... />

// Updated
<Label>
  Business Function
  <Badge variant="outline" className="ml-2 text-blue-600">Gate Required</Badge>
</Label>
<Select ... />

Task 3: Add Status Validation Indicator
When the user selects "Discovery" status, show a warning that Gate 1 cannot pass:
Option A: Disable certain statuses with tooltip
tsx<SelectItem value="Discovery" disabled={false}>
  Discovery
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-xs ml-2">(Gate 1 blocked)</span>
</SelectItem>
Option B: Show inline warning when Discovery is selected
tsx{status === 'Discovery' && (
  <p className="text-amber-600 text-sm mt-1">
    ℹ️ Use cases in Discovery status cannot pass Gate 1. Change status to proceed with governance.
  </p>
)}

Task 4: Update Governance Stepper Tooltip/Details
In the stepper at the top (Image 1), when hovering or clicking on "Operating Model", it should show all 3 requirements, not just Primary Business Owner.
File: Likely client/src/components/lego-blocks/GovernanceStepperLegoBlock.tsx
Update the gate requirements display to show:
tsxconst gate1Requirements = [
  { field: 'primaryBusinessOwner', label: 'Primary Business Owner', met: !!useCase.primaryBusinessOwner },
  { field: 'businessFunction', label: 'Business Function', met: !!useCase.businessFunction },
  { field: 'status', label: 'Status beyond Discovery', met: useCase.useCaseStatus !== 'Discovery' }
];
```

---

### Task 5: Verify Ownership Section Header

In Image 1, the Ownership section shows:
```
Ownership
Required for Operating Model gate
```

This is good, but ensure it reflects all requirements. Consider updating to:
```
Ownership & Classification
Required for Operating Model gate (Gate 1)
And group the Status field with this section since it's also a Gate 1 requirement.

Task 6: Update Tab Progress Calculation
The "Operating Model 0%" tab should calculate progress based on all 3 fields:
typescript// Current calculation (likely)
const gate1Progress = primaryBusinessOwner ? 100 : 0;

// Updated calculation
const gate1Fields = [
  !!useCase.primaryBusinessOwner,
  !!useCase.businessFunction,
  useCase.useCaseStatus !== 'Discovery'
];
const gate1Progress = Math.round((gate1Fields.filter(Boolean).length / 3) * 100);

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
After completing UI updates, verify:

 Guide shows all 3 Gate 1 requirements
 Business Function has "Gate Required" badge
 Status field shows Discovery limitation
 Operating Model tab shows correct progress (0%, 33%, 67%, 100%)
 Stepper tooltip/popover shows all 3 requirements
 Creating a use case with all 3 fields shows Gate 1 as "Passed"
 Creating a use case with only Primary Business Owner shows Gate 1 as ~33% complete


REFERENCE: replit.md Principles
Per the project conventions:

LEGO-style components: Changes should be made in the appropriate lego-block component
Metadata-driven: If gate requirements are configurable, pull from metadata_config rather than hardcoding
Consistent badging: Use the same "Gate Required" badge style for all gate-required fields
