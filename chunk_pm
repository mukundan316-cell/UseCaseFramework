      "problemStatement": "Integration gaps between Guidewire and Claims Connect mean supplier invoices, reserves, and payments are not always synchronized. Handlers and finance staff manually confirm data across systems, leading to mismatches, delayed reconciliations, disputes with suppliers, and financial leakage. Audit trails are incomplete, and suppliers often face payment delays.",
