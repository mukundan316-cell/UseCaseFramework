      "description": "An automated risk-enrichment service that, post-ingestion, queries public news/press sources, corporate registries, and industry feeds to auto-flag relevant red flags (e.g., incidents, adverse filings, regulatory actions) with confidence scoring and citations. Summaries are embedded in PowerUp (or equivalent workbench) with links to sources. (Note: Sanctions/watchlists enforcement remains a dedicated compliance control in UC9, but high-level sanction flags can be surfaced in the same panel for completeness.)",
      "problemStatement": "After Instabase converts broker slips to structured data, underwriters still perform manual external research (news, company events, asset incidents) to uncover red flags. This is time-consuming, inconsistent across individuals, and risks missed adverse signals.",
