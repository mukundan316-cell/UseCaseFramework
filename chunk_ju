      "problemStatement": "Hazard context (e.g., flood risk, fire exposure, severe weather patterns) is often missed or captured late in the commercial property claims process. Handlers rely on manual searches or adjuster experience, leading to under-reserving, overlooked mitigation opportunities, and inconsistent decision-making.",
