      "problemStatement": "Underwriting SOPs are fragmented across LOBs (Marine, Property, Aviation, Specialty). Current documentation is inconsistent, outdated, and scattered across shared drives. This creates onboarding challenges, inconsistent underwriting practices, and compliance risks. Andrew Hall is informally collecting SOPs but lacks a unified approach.",
