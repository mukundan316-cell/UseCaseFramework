      "description": "Drone-based aerial imaging analyzed with computer vision for hazard detection\r\r\nWearables for surveyors to capture real-time environmental/safety data\r\r\nAI-driven hazard classification and auto-ingestion of findings into survey reports\r\r\nIntegration of outputs into underwriting workflows and client-facing risk portals.",
      "problemStatement": "Risk Consulting surveys are performed manually by site engineers, relying on notes and photos. Hazards (e.g., fire exits, roof defects, flood risks) are often missed, reports are inconsistent, and turnaround times are slow. Underwriters and clients depend on these reports, leading to downstream pricing and prevention challenges when data is incomplete. Surveyors also face safety risks in hazardous environments.",
