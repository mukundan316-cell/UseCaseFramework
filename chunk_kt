      "description": "Embedded supplier orchestration within Guidewire, integrated with Claims Connect via APIs/queues\r\r\nAI-based supplier recommendation at FNOL (rank by location, capacity, SLA performance, specialization)\r\r\nEvent-driven synchronization: supplier instructions, appointments, updates, and documents flow automatically back to the claim record\r\r\nNLP auto-notes: summarize supplier updates into structured Guidewire notes/tasks\r\r\nException handling: flag delays/SLA breaches; trigger escalation or reallocation.",
      "problemStatement": "Claims handlers must leave Guidewire to instruct and manage suppliers in Claims Connect, then manually re-enter updates into Guidewire. This dual navigation causes delays, rekeying errors, inconsistent status, and weak SLA visibility. Customers and brokers wait longer for supplier contact and resolution.",
