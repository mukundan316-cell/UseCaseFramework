      "description": "AI-based triage engine leveraging claim attributes beyond value (LOB, complexity, completeness of documentation, claimant profile, geography)\r\r\nWorkload balancing algorithm to dynamically allocate claims based on adjuster availability, skill, and SLA requirements\r\r\nSeamless Guidewire integration to present real-time routing decisions at FNOL.",
      "problemStatement": "Claims routing is still based on manual triage using value thresholds (<£10K hubs, £10–100K adjusters, >£100K major loss). This creates delays, inconsistent allocations, and inefficient resource use. Complex low-value claims may be mishandled, while simple higher-value claims consume adjuster capacity unnecessarily.",
