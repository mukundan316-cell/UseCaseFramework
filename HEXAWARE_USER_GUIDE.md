## Getting Started

When you first open the portal, you'll see the main dashboard with three tabs at the top:

- **Hexaware Internal** - Use cases specific to Hexaware operations
- **Industry Standard** - Best practice use cases from across the industry
- **AI Inventory** - Existing AI tools and models currently in use

Each tab contains use cases organized in a searchable, filterable table.

---

## Understanding the Three Libraries

### Hexaware Internal
These are AI use cases developed specifically for Hexaware's internal operations. Examples include:
- Process automation projects
- Internal tool development
- Employee-facing AI applications

### Industry Standard
These are proven AI use cases from industry best practices. Use these as inspiration or reference when planning your own initiatives.

### AI Inventory
This is your catalog of existing AI tools and models currently deployed at Hexaware. This helps with:
- Governance and compliance
- Risk assessment
- Understanding what's already available before building new solutions

---

## Viewing Use Cases

### Browse and Search
1. Click on any of the three tabs (Hexaware Internal, Industry Standard, AI Inventory)
2. Use the **search box** at the top to find specific use cases by name or description
3. Use the **filter dropdowns** to narrow results by:
   - Business function
   - Process area
   - Status
   - Geography

### View Details
1. Click on any use case row to open the detailed view
2. You'll see three tabs within the detail view:
   - **Core & Scoring** - Basic information and impact/effort scores
   - **AI Governance** - Risk assessment and compliance information
   - **Implementation** - Timeline, dependencies, and success metrics

---

## Creating a New Use Case

### Step 1: Click "Add New Use Case"
Look for the blue button at the top right of any library tab.

### Step 2: Fill in Basic Information
**Required fields** (marked with *):
- **Title*** - A clear, descriptive name for your use case
- **Description*** - What does this use case do? (2-3 sentences)

**Recommended fields**:
- **Problem Statement** - What business problem does this solve?
- **Business Segments** - Which parts of the organization benefit?
- **Processes** - Which processes are involved?

### Step 3: Score the Use Case
See the [Scoring Your Use Cases](#scoring-your-use-cases) section below.

### Step 4: Save
Click **"Create Use Case"** at the bottom. Your use case will receive a unique ID automatically (e.g., HEX_INT_001).

---

## Scoring Your Use Cases

Every use case is evaluated on two dimensions: **Impact** and **Effort**.

### Impact Score (1-5 scale)
Higher scores = Greater business value

Rate each factor from 1 (Low) to 5 (Very High):

1. **Revenue Impact** - Will this increase revenue?
   - 1 = No impact
   - 5 = Major revenue driver

2. **Cost Savings** - Will this reduce costs?
   - 1 = Minimal savings
   - 5 = Significant cost reduction

3. **Risk Reduction** - Will this reduce business risk?
   - 1 = No risk impact
   - 5 = Major risk mitigation

4. **Partner Experience** - Will this improve partner/customer satisfaction?
   - 1 = No impact
   - 5 = Transformative improvement

5. **Strategic Fit** - How well does this align with company strategy?
   - 1 = Misaligned
   - 5 = Perfect strategic fit

### Effort Score (1-5 scale)
Higher scores = More difficult to implement

Rate each factor from 1 (Easy) to 5 (Very Difficult):

1. **Data Readiness** - Is the required data available and clean?
   - 1 = Data ready to use
   - 5 = Data needs major work

2. **Technical Complexity** - How complex is the solution?
   - 1 = Simple implementation
   - 5 = Highly complex

3. **Change Impact** - How much organizational change is needed?
   - 1 = Minimal change
   - 5 = Major transformation

4. **Model Risk** - What's the risk if the AI model fails?
   - 1 = Low risk
   - 5 = Critical risk

5. **Adoption Readiness** - Are users ready to adopt this?
   - 1 = Users eager and ready
   - 5 = High resistance expected

### Automatic Calculation
The system automatically calculates:
- **Impact Score** (average of 5 impact factors)
- **Effort Score** (average of 5 effort factors)
- **Quadrant placement** (see Priority Matrix below)

### Manual Override
If you need to adjust the calculated scores:
1. Toggle **"Use Manual Scores"** in the detail view
2. Enter your custom Impact and Effort scores
3. Provide a reason for the override
4. Save your changes

---

## Understanding the Priority Matrix

Click the **"Executive Dashboard"** button to see the Priority Matrix - a visual chart showing all use cases plotted by Impact vs. Effort.

### The Four Quadrants

**Quick Wins** (High Impact, Low Effort)
- ✅ **Priority: Immediate action**
- These deliver great value with minimal effort
- Start here!

**Strategic Initiatives** (High Impact, High Effort)
- ⏳ **Priority: Plan carefully**
- High value but require significant investment
- Plan these for long-term execution

**Low Hanging Fruit** (Low Impact, Low Effort)
- 🍎 **Priority: Fill gaps**
- Easy to implement but limited value
- Good for building momentum

**Money Pit** (Low Impact, High Effort)
- ⚠️ **Priority: Avoid or reconsider**
- Hard to implement with low return
- Usually should be deprioritized

### Reading the Chart
- **Bubble size** = Relative importance
- **X-axis** = Effort Score (1-5, left to right)
- **Y-axis** = Impact Score (1-5, bottom to top)
- **Hover over bubbles** to see details
- **Click bubbles** to open use case details

## T-shirt Sizing

T-shirt sizing helps estimate the cost, timeline, and resources needed for each use case.

### Understanding Sizes
- **XS** - Very small project (2-4 weeks, 1-2 people)
- **S** - Small project (4-8 weeks, 2-3 people)
- **M** - Medium project (8-16 weeks, 3-5 people)
- **L** - Large project (16-24 weeks, 5-8 people)
- **XL** - Very large project (24+ weeks, 8+ people)

### How It Works
1. Open a use case detail view
2. Scroll to the **"T-shirt Sizing"** section
3. The system automatically suggests a size based on your effort score
4. Review the estimates:
   - Cost range (£ GBP)
   - Timeline (weeks)
   - Team size needed
   - Resource breakdown by role

### Resource Planning Table
The table shows:
- **Developer** roles and daily rates
- **Analyst** roles and daily rates
- **Project Manager** allocation
- **Total estimated cost** with overhead
- **Benefit calculations** based on impact score

### Adjusting Estimates
