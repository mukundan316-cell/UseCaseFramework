      "problemStatement": "Renewal prep is manual and inconsistent. Pre-renewal triggers (90 days prior) must be set up and tracked manually in PAS/MSD. Terrorism questionnaires are manually generated, sent, and chased by underwriters, consuming valuable time. Responses are collated via spreadsheets, creating high risk of missed deadlines, errors, and inconsistent follow-ups. Reputational damage occurs when renewals are delayed or incomplete.",
