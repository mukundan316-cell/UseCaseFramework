      "problemStatement": "Renewal fast-tracking depends on a manual Excel workbook containing 7 underwriting rules. Underwriters/ops must export data, run checks in Excel, and re-key results into PAS/doc gen. This introduces errors, inconsistent application across users, and missed exceptions. Despite being stable and repeatable, the process remains manual, creating delays and leakage.",
