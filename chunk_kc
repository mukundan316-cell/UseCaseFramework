      "problemStatement": "Documents produced by raters and AIS require heavy manual editing by underwriters to add clauses, exceptions, and endorsements. Formatting errors and inconsistent clause usage across underwriters lead to compliance risk and rework. Storage in shared drives is inconsistent, with missing metadata/tags, making retrieval and audit difficult. Ops teams must re-check and fix formatting/scanning issues downstream.",
