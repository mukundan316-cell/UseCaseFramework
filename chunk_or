      "problemStatement": "Policy documents (especially inception versions) are not automatically attached in Guidewire. Claims handlers must manually chase underwriters or brokers for missing files, delaying claim setup and coverage validation. This creates inefficiency, poor customer/broker experience, and frustration across claims and underwriting teams.",
