      "problemStatement": "Claims handlers rely heavily on free-text notes in Guidewire and other systems. Notes are long, inconsistent, and lack structured coding. This leads to delays (handlers re-read histories), inconsistent MI, and missed opportunities for proactive actions (fraud, subrogation, customer risk). Supervisors and auditors also struggle to review cases quickly.",
