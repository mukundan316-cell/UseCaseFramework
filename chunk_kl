      "description": "RPA bots to handle repetitive PAS tasks (policy setup, amendments, renewals)\r\r\nBots for AIS document handling (auto-populate, attach to policy)\r\r\nAI-enabled validation to catch mismatches between PAS and doc outputs\r\r\nAutomation built as a “bridge” until DxC PAS rollout.",
      "problemStatement": "Legacy UKRIS PAS and AIS are outdated, fragmented systems. Underwriters face heavy manual rekeying, doc mismatches, and inefficient workflows. AIS is not integrated, so documents require manual intervention. Modernization (DxC PAS) is in progress but will take years, leaving an immediate productivity and error-risk gap.",
