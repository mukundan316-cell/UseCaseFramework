      "problemStatement": "Instabase ingests broker slips but lacks intelligence for validation and enrichment. Underwriters manually cross-check extracted data against original slips and external sources (sanctions, news, public data). This creates delays, errors, and duplicated effort. Ops must fix issues late in the process when validation gaps are discovered.",
