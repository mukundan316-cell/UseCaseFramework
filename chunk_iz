      "description": "AI-enabled enrichment pipelines that ingest external broker feeds/portals and unify with PAS/claims datasets.\r\r\nEntity resolution, schema harmonization, quality controls/exception reports (as done in Unicorn today).\r\r\nFeed PowerUp and operational apps with governed, decision-ready data.\r\r\nDesign to repoint to EDP later without re-engineering.",
      "problemStatement": "External broker/market data and internal PAS/claims data are not seamlessly integrated; teams rely on manual stitching for insights. EDP is the target end-state, but near-term value is needed.",
